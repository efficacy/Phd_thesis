	abstract = {Objective: The primary objective of this study is to study the presence of blocks during programming and their potential causes.
Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with experienced programmers to capture their processes, the problems they face, and potential causes. Subsequently, we analyzed the responses through the lens of writing.
Results: We found that among the programmer’s problems during programming, several display strong similarities to writer’s block. Moreover, when investigating possible causes of such blocks, we found a strong relationship between programming and writing activities as well as typical writing strategies employed by programmers.
Conclusions: Strong similarities between programming and writing challenges, processes, and strategies confirm the existence of programmer’s block with similar causes to writer’s block. Thus, strategies from writing used to resolve blocks should be applicable in programming, helping developers to overcome},

              INTRODUCTION
              There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).
            
            
              RESULTS
              Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development.

                    The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables.

            The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.},

	abstract = {Various ﬁelds of manufacturing, management, and business, including technology education, software development, and information communication technology (ICT), have espoused sustainability concepts. Including sustainability concepts in technology, education can help students learn how to implement the dimensions of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental). Lack of awareness and education regarding sustainability among students can impact their competence to incorporate sustainability into technology development. Thus, the development of student competence across the curriculum of technology education for sustainability is crucial. This research aims to explore student competence development in technology education (IT, computer science, and software development) through investigating their awareness of sustainability, and to investigate how much sustainability is infused across the technology education curriculum. The case study for this research is taken from a very populous and developing country—Pakistan. First, an in-depth survey of higher education students is conducted to investigate their awareness level of sustainability. Second, qualitative document analysis is conducted, where the standard curriculum for technology education is taken and analyzed for its provision towards sustainability. A total of 159 students from various public-sector universities of Pakistan reported their awareness towards sustainability. The results show that 71\% of them are unaware of the term sustainability in their respective ﬁelds, only 17\% students know the basic deﬁnition of sustainability, and 12\% of students have just an idea of how sustainability is related to technology education. It is also observed that the current curriculum of technology education does not suﬃciently cover speciﬁc subjects or topics that can help students understand the concepts of sustainability. This study highlights the gaps in the oﬀered curriculum for building the desired competence of students in technology education.},

	title = {An {Illumination} of the {Template} {Enigma}: {Software} {Code} {Generation} with {Templates}},
	abstract = {Creating software is a process of refining a concept to an implementation. This process consists of several stages represented by documents, models and plans at several levels of abstraction. Mostly, the refinement process requires creativity of the programmers, but sometimes the task is boring and repetitive. This repetitive work is an indication that the program is not written at the most suitable level of abstraction. The level of abstraction offered by the used programming language might be too low to remove the recurring code. Code generators can be used to raise the level of abstraction of program specifications and to automate the repetitive work. This thesis focuses on code generators based on templates. Templates are one of the techniques to implement a code generator. Templates allow extension of the syntax of a programming language, enabling generative programming without modifying the underlying compiler. Four artifacts are involved in a template based generator: templates, input data, a template evaluator and output code. The templates we consider are a concrete (incomplete) representation of the output document, i.e. object code, that contains holes, i.e. the meta code. These holes are filled by the template evaluator using information from the input data to obtain the output code. Templates are widely used to generate HTML code in web applications. They can be used for generating all kinds of text, like e-mails or (source) code. In this thesis we limit the scope to the generation of source code. The central research question is how the quality of template based code generators can be improved. Quality, in general, is a broad notion and our scope is limited to the technical quality of templates and generated code. We focused on improving the maintainability of template based code generators and the correctness of the generated code. This is facilitated by the three main contributions provided by this thesis. First, the maintainability of template based code generators is increased by specifying the following requirement for our metalanguage. Our metalanguage should not be rich enough to allow programming in templates, without being too restrictive to express some code generators. We used the theory of formal languages to specify our metalanguage. Second, we ensure correctness of the templates and generated code. Third, the presented theory and techniques are validated by case studies. These case studies show application of templates in real world applications, increased maintainability and syntactical correctness of generated code. Our metalanguage should not be rich enough to allow programming in templates, without being too restrictive to express some code generators. The theory of formal languages is used to specify the requirements for our metalanguage. As we only consider to generate programming languages, it is sufficient to support the generation of languages defined by context-free grammars. This assumption is used to derive a metalanguage, that is rich enough to specify code generators that are able to instantiate all possible sentences of a context-free language. A specific case of a code generator, the unparser, is a program that can instantiate all sentences of a context-free language. We proved that an unparser can be implemented using a linear deterministic topdown tree-to-string transducer. We call this property unparser-completeness. Our metalanguage is based on a linear deterministic top-down tree-to-string transducer. Recall that the goal of specifying the requirements of the metalanguage is to increase the maintainability of template based code generators, without being too restrictive. To validate that our metalanguage is not too restrictive and leads to better maintainable templates, we compared it with four off-the-shelf text template systems by implementing an unparser. We have observed that the industrial template evaluators provide a Turing complete metalanguage, but they do not contain a block scoping mechanism for the meta-variables. This results in undesired additional boilerplate meta code in their templates. The second contribution is guaranteeing the correctness of the generated code. Correctness of the generated code can be divided in two concerns: syntactical correctness and semantical correctness. We start with syntactical correctness of the generated code. The use of text templates implies that syntactical correctness of the generated code can only be detected at compilation time. This means that errors detected during the compilation are reported on the level of the generated code. The developer is required to trace back manually the errors to their origin in the template or input data. We believe that programs manipulating source code should not consider the object code as text to detect errors as early as possible. We present an approach where the grammars of the object language and metalanguage can be combined in a modular way. Combining both grammars allows parsing both languages simultaneously. Syntax errors in both languages of the template will be found while parsing it. Moreover, only parsing a template is not sufficient to ensure that the generated code will be free of syntax errors. The template evaluator must be equipped with a mechanism to guarantee its output will be syntactically correct. We discuss our mechanism in short. A parse tree is constructed during the parsing of the template. This tree contains subtrees for the object code and subtrees for the meta code. While evaluating the template, subtrees of the meta code are substituted by object code subtrees. The template evaluator checks whether the root nonterminal of the object code subtree is equal to the root nonterminal of the meta code subtree. When both are equal, it is allowed to substitute the meta code. When the root nonterminals are distinct an accurate error message is generated. The template evaluator terminates when all meta code subtrees are substituted. The result is a parse tree of the object language and thus syntactically correct. We call this process syntax safe code generation. In order to validate that the presented techniques increase maintainability and ensure syntactical correctness, we implemented our ideas in a syntax safe template evaluator called Repleo. Repleo has been applied in four case studies. The first case is a real world situation, where it is required to generate a three tier web application from a data model. This case showed that multiple layers of an applications defined in different programming languages can be generated from a single model. The second case and third case are used to show that our metalanguage results in a better maintainable code generator. Our metalanguage forces to use a two layer code generator with separation of concerns between the two layers, where the original implementations are less modular. The last case study shows that ensuring syntactical correctness results in the prevention of cross-site scripting attacks in dynamic generation of web pages. Recall that one of our goals was ensuring the correctness of the generated code. We also showed that is possible to check static semantic properties of templates. Static semantic checks are defined for the metalanguage, for the object language and checks for the situations where the object language is dependent on the metalanguage. We implemented a prototype of a static semantic checker for PicoJava templates using attribute grammars. The use of attribute grammars leads to re-use of the original PicoJava checker. Summarizing, in this thesis we have formulated the requirements for a metalanguage and discussed how to implement a syntax safe template evaluator. This results in better maintainable template based code generators and more reliable generated code.},

Power consumption is becoming a large factor to take into account since a lot of the processors being used today reside within mobile devices, for example mobile phones.

	abstract = {Background: The pattern of energy expenditure during sustained high-intensity exercise is influenced by several variables. Data from athletic populations suggest that a pre-exercise conceptual model, or template, is a central variable relative to controlling energy expenditure. Aims: The aim of this study was to make systematic observations regarding how the performance template develops in fit individuals who have limited specific experience with sustained high-intensity exercise (eg, time trials).
Methods: The study was conducted in four parts and involved measuring performance (time and power output) during: (A) six 3 km cycle time trials, (B) three 2 km rowing time trials, (C) four 2 km rowing time trials with a training period between trials 2 and 3, and (D) three 10 km cycle time trials. All time trials were self-paced with feedback to the subjects regarding previous performances and momentary pace.
Results: In all four series of time trials there was a progressive pattern of improved performance averaging 6\% over the first three trials and 10\% over six trials. In all studies improvement was associated with increased power output during the early and middle portions of the time trial and a progressively greater terminal rating of perceived exertion. Despite the change in the pattern of energy expenditure, the subjects did not achieve the pattern usually displayed by athletes during comparable events.
Conclusions: This study concludes that the pattern of learning the performance template is primarily related to increased confidence that the trial can be completed without unreasonable levels of exertion or injury, but that the process takes more than six trials to be complete.},

Rather it is always set in the I context of decisions about what type of system is to be sustained and over what spatiotemporal scale. :rhere is a duality of the material system itself, as opposed to human frameworks for communication or management action. Exclusive focus on the material system gives the decision-maker an impossible number of choices, and no definitions; exclusive focus on scale and type gives narrowly directe.d capricious action that ignores lessons from the material system. An ide,al is guided by the principal physical and biological material flows, as the scientist erects a rich system definition that explicitly links different types of system, like landscape and ecosystem, across a range of scales, in a coherent complex management scheme. Sustainability is not a matter of degree, because the material imbalances of incomplete sustainability will bring all down like the ancient failure of Sumerian agriculture through salination. True, sustaining at one scale may deny sustainability at another, but if it is in a scale- explicit framework, trade-offs can be calculated and weighed. Sustainability must work with natural processes, but they are not those of the pristine system. Rather management must accommodate to new structures and their patterns of process which naturally emerge far from equilibrium as a result of a substantial human presence. In a world with 5 billion people, managing towards a pristine system is irresponsible.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Nemo – a practical in situ power metering system for wireless sensor networks. Nemo features a new circuit design called shunt resistor switch that can dynamically adjust the resistance of shunt resistors based on the current load. This allows Nemo to achieve a wide dynamic current range and high measurement accuracy. Nemo transmits real-time power measurements to the host node solely through the power line, by modulating the current load and the supply voltage. This feature leads to a noninvasive, plug \& play design that allows Nemo to be easily installed on existing mote platforms without physical wiring or soldering. We have implemented a prototype of Nemo and conducted extensive experimental evaluation. Our results show that Nemo can transmit high-throughput measurement data to the host through voltage/current load modulation. Moreover, it has satisfactory measurement ﬁdelity over a wide range of operating conditions. In particular, Nemo yields a dynamic measurement range of 250,000:1, which is 2.5X and 7X that of two state-of-the-art sensor network power meter systems, while only incurring an average measurement error of 1.34\%. We also use a case study to demonstrate that Nemo is able to track the highly dynamic sleep current consumption of TelosB motes, which has important implications for the design of low duty-cycle sensor networks that operate in dynamic environments.},

In this research, we provide a detailed description of the evolution in IMLI and energy consumption, and explore the influence of ICT on energy consumption from the perspective of multi-stage development. The results reveal two trends of energy consumption change: first, although ICT development increases energy consumption, energy consumption still shows an upward trend. The total energy consumption grew from 2182.72 TWh per year in 2001 to 17959.11 TWh per year in 2030, the CAGR of energy consumption is 7.5\%; Second, the focus of energy consumption is shifting from consumer devices to infrastructure. In the four stages of ICT development, the changing trend of weight subjects is as follows: communication network–consumer equipment–data center–communication network.

For effective knowledge sharing, it is therefore important to have a unified classification system by means of which the bodies of knowledge that constitute the field may be compared and contrasted. This paper presents a multi-faceted system based on five research-focused characteristics: topic, approach, method, unit of analysis, and reference discipline.

	abstract = {Background: Digital infrastructures, i.e., ICT systems, or system-of-systems, providing digital capabilities, such as storage and computational services, are experiencing an ever-growing demand for data consumption, which is only expected to increase in the future. This trend leads to a question we need to answer: How can we evolve digital infrastructures to keep up with the increasing data demand in a sustainable way?
Objective: The goal of this study is to understand what is the future of sustainable digital infrastructures, in terms of: which solutions are, or will be, available to sustainably evolve digital infrastructures, and which are the related adoption factors, impediments, and open problems.
Method: We carried out a 3-phase mixed-method qualitative empirical study, comprising semistructured interviews, followed by focus groups, and a plenary session with parallel working groups. In total, we conducted 13 sessions involving 48 digital infrastructure practitioners and researchers.
Results: From our investigation emerges a landscape for sustainable digital infrastructures, composed of 30 solutions, 5 adoption factors, 4 impediments, and 13 open problems. We further synthesized our results in 4 incremental scenarios, which outline the future evolution of sustainable digital infrastructures.
Conclusions: From an initial shift from on-premise to the cloud, as time progresses, digital infrastructures are expected to become increasingly distributed, till it will be possible to dynamically allocate resources by following time, space, and energy. Numerous solutions will support this change, but digital infrastructures are envisaged to be able to evolve sustainably only by (i) gaining a wider awareness of digital sustainability, (ii) holding every party accountable for their sustainability throughout value chains, and (iii) establishing cross-domain collaborations.},

	abstract = {Internet service utilities host multiple server applica- tions on a shared server cluster (server farm). One of the essential tasks of the hosting service provider is to allocate servers to each of the websites to maintain a certain level of quality of service for dif- ferent classes of incoming requests at each point of time, and opti- mize the use of server resources, while maximizing its profits. Such a proactive management of resources requires accurate prediction of workload, which is generally measured as the amount of service requests per unit time. As a time series, the workload exhibits not only short time random fluctuations but also prominent periodic (daily) patterns that evolve randomly from one period to another. We propose a solution to theWeb server load prediction problem based on a hierarchical framework with multiple time scales. This framework leads to adaptive procedures that provide both long- term (in days) and short-term (in minutes) predictions with si- multaneous confidence bands which accommodate not only serial correlation but also heavy-tailedness, and nonstationarity of the data. The long-term load is modeled as a dynamic harmonic regres- sion (DHR), the coefficients of which evolve according to a random walk, and are tracked using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algo- rithms; whereas the short-term load is predicted using an autore- gressive model, whose parameters are also estimated using SMC techniques.We evaluate our method using real-worldWeb work- load data.},

Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reason-ing about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability – the capacity to endure in changing environments – is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice. Problem: Accidental software complexity accrues both naturally and gradually over time as part of the overall software design and development process. From a software architecture perspective, this allows several issues to overlap including, but not limited to: the accumulation of technical debt design deci-sions of individual components and systems leading to coupling and cohesion issues; the application of tacit architectural knowledge resulting in unsystematic and undocumented design decisions; architectural knowledge vaporisation of design choices and the continued ability of the organization to understand the architecture of its systems; sustainability debt and the broader cumulative effects of flawed architectural design choices over time resulting in code smells, architectural brittleness, erosion, and drift, which ulti-mately lead to decay and software death. Sustainable software architectures are required to evolve over the entire lifecycle of the system from initial design inception to end-of-life to achieve efficient and ef-fective maintenance and evolutionary change. Method: This article outlines general principles and perspectives on sustainability with regards to soft-ware systems to provide a context and terminology for framing the discourse on software architectures and sustainability. Focusing on the capacity of software architectures and architectural design choices to endure over time, it highlights some of the recent research trends and approaches with regards to ex-plicitly addressing sustainability in the context of software architectures. Contribution: The principal aim of this article is to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging re-search themes in the area of sustainable software architectures highlighting recent trends, and open is-sues and research challenges.},

Our study focuses on the tradeoff between power and performance in such systems. Our premise is that low-power computing platforms can provide adequate performance for low-volume Websites run by small businesses or groups, while delivering a significantly higher request per Watt. We use the popular Raspberry Pi platform as an example low-power computing platform and experimentally evaluate our hypothesis for static and dynamic Web content served using this platform. Our result show that this platform can provide comparable response times to more capable server-class machines for rates up to 200 requests per second (rps); however, the scalability of the system is reduced to 20 rps for serving more compute-intensive dynamic content. Next, we study the feasibility of using clusters of low-power systems to serve requests for larger Websites. We find that, by utilising low-power multi-server clusters, we can achieve 17x to 23x more requests per Watt than typical tower server systems. Using simulations driven by parameters obtained from our real-world experiments, we also study dynamic multi-server policies that consider the tradeoff between power savings and overhead cost of turning servers on and off.},

To structure and better understand the SE body of knowledge, taxonomies have been proposed in all SE knowledge areas. Objective : The objective of this paper is to characterize the state-of-the-art research on SE taxonomies. Method : A systematic mapping study was conducted, based on 270 primary studies. Results : An increasing number of SE taxonomies have been published since 20 0 0 in a broad range of venues, including the top SE journals and conferences. The majority of taxonomies can be grouped into the following SWEBOK knowledge areas: construction (19.55\%), design (19.55\%), requirements (15.50\%) and maintenance (11.81\%). Illustration (45.76\%) is the most frequently used approach for taxonomy vali-dation. Hierarchy (53.14\%) and faceted analysis (39.48\%) are the most frequently used classification struc-tures. Most taxonomies rely on qualitative procedures to classify subject matter instances, but in most cases (86.53\%) these procedures are not described in sufficient detail. The majority of the taxonomies (97\%) target unique subject matters and many taxonomy-papers are cited frequently. Most SE taxonomies are designed in an ad-hoc way. To address this issue, we have revised an existing method for developing taxonomies in a more systematic way. Conclusion : There is a strong interest in taxonomies in SE, but few taxonomies are extended or revised. Taxonomy design decisions regarding the used classification structures, procedures and descriptive bases are usually not well described and motivated.},

            This article presents a study on the quality and execution of research code from publicly-available replication datasets at the Harvard Dataverse repository. Research code is typically created by a group of scientists and published together with academic papers to facilitate research transparency and reproducibility. For this study, we define ten questions to address aspects impacting research reproducibility and reuse. First, we retrieve and analyze more than 2000 replication datasets with over 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020. Second, we execute the code in a clean runtime environment to assess its ease of reuse. Common coding errors were identified, and some of them were solved with automatic code cleaning to aid code execution. We find that 74\% of R files failed to complete without error in the initial execution, while 56\% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that many errors can be prevented with good coding practices. We also analyze the replication datasets from journals’ collections and discuss the impact of the journal policy strictness on the code re-execution rate. Finally, based on our results, we propose a set of recommendations for code dissemination aimed at researchers, journals, and repositories.},

To this end, we report the ﬁndings from a targeted survey of 33 academics on the presence of green and sustainable software engineering in higher education. The major ﬁndings from the collected data suggest that sustainability is under-represented in the curricula, while the current focus of teaching is on energy efﬁciency delivered through a fact-based approach. The reasons vary from lack of awareness, teaching material and suitable technologies, to the high effort required to teach sustainability. Finally, we provide recommendations for educators willing to teach sustainability in software engineering that can help to suit millennial students needs.},

This paper discusses the altruistic sharing of knowledge between knowledge providers and knowledge seekers in the Developer and User mailing lists of the Debian project. We analyze the posting and replying activities of the participants by counting the number of email messages they posted to the lists and the number of replies they made to questions others posted. We found out that participants interact and share their knowledge a lot, their positing activity is fairly highly correlated with their replying activity, the characteristics of posting and replying activities are different for different kinds of lists, and the knowledge sharing activity of self-organizing Free/Open Source communities could best be explained in terms of what we called ''Fractal Cubic Distribution'' rather than the power-law distribution mostly reported in the literature. The paper also proposes what could be researched in knowledge sharing activities in F/OSS projects mailing list and for what purpose.

	abstract = {Context: Smells in software systems impair software quality and make them hard to maintain and evolve. The software engineering community has explored various dimensions concerning smells and produced extensive research related to smells. The plethora of information poses challenges to the community to comprehend the state-of-the-art tools and techniques. Objective: We aim to present the current knowledge related to software smells and identify challenges as well as opportunities in the current practices. Method: We explore the definitions of smells, their causes as well as effects, and their detection mech-anisms presented in the current literature. We studied 445 primary studies in detail, synthesized the information, and documented our observations. Results: The study reveals five possible defining characteristics of smells — indicator, poor solution, violates best-practices, impacts quality, and recurrence . We curate ten common factors that cause smells to occur including lack of skill or awareness and priority to features over quality . We classify existing smell detection methods into five groups — metrics, rules/heuristics, history, machine learning, and optimization-based de-tection . Challenges in the smells detection include the tools' proneness to false-positives and poor coverage of smells detectable by existing tools .},

	abstract = {Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peerreviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predeﬁned criteria. We have identiﬁed 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: 1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); 2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; 3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; 4) detecting violations, ﬂaws, and faults in CI; 5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and 6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7\%) and evaluation (36.2\%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenﬁeld and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.},

	abstract = {As the use of computers has grown, so too has concern about the amount of power they consume. Data centers, for example, are limited in scalability as they struggle with soaring energy costs from many large companies relying on fast, reliable, and round-the-clock computing services. On large-scale computing clusters, like data centers, even a small drop in power consumption can have large effects. Across computing contexts, reducing power consumed by computers has become a major focus. In this paper, we present a new approach for mapping software design to power consumption and present empirical results of the approach on different software implementations. In particular, we compare the power profiles of software using design patterns against software not using design patterns as a way to explore how high-level design decisions affect an application's energy usage. We show how mappings between software design and power consumption profiles can provide software designers and developers with useful information about the power behavior of the software they are developing. The goal is for software engineers to use this information in designing and developing more energy efficient solutions. © 2012 IEEE.},

Archival data of projects hosted at SourceForge.net are used for the empirical validation of the measure. An Analysis Sample (n=136) is used to assign weights to each dimension of project viability and to determine a suitable cut-off point for VI. Cross-validation of the measure is performed on a hold-out Validation Sample (n=96). We demonstrate that project viability is a robust and valid measure of OSS project survivability that can be used to predict the failure or survival of an OSS project accurately.

Method: We conduct our research study by searching ﬁve scholar databases. We collect a set of 31,498 publications by using seven search strings. By systematically applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, which includes removing duplicates and removing non-English and non peer-reviewed publications, we identify 32 publications related to IaC. We identify topics addressed in these publications by applying qualitative analysis.
Results: We identify four topics studied in IaC-related publications: (i) framework/tool for infrastructure as code; (ii) adoption of infrastructure as code; (iii) empirical study related to infrastructure as code; and (iv) testing in infrastructure as code. According to our analysis, 50.0\% of the studied 32 publications propose a framework or tool to implement the practice of IaC or extend the functionality of an existing IaC tool.
Conclusion: Our ﬁndings suggest that framework or tools is a well-studied topic in IaC research. As defects and security ﬂaws can have serious consequences for the deployment and development environments in DevOps, we observe the need for research studies that will study defects and security ﬂaws for IaC.},

This has led to an intensiﬁed interest in technological climate interventions that involve increasing the reﬂection of sunlight to space by injecting substances into the stratosphere which lead to the formation of highly reﬂective particles. When ﬁrst suggested, such albedo modiﬁcation schemes were introduced as a “Plan B,” in case the world economy fails to decarbonize, and this scenario has dominated much of the public perception of albedo modiﬁcation as a savior waiting in the wings to protect the world against massive climate change arising from a failure to decarbonize.},

Indeed, we seek to establish and analyze different rankings for programming languages based on their energy efficiency. The goal of being able to rank programming languages based on their energy efficiency is both recent, and certainly deserves further studies. We have taken rigorous and strict solutions to 10 well defined programming problems, expressed in (up to) 27 programming languages, from the well known Computer Language Benchmark Game repository. This repository aims to compare programming languages based on a strict set of implementation rules and configurations for each benchmarking problem. We have also built a framework to automatically, and systematically, run, measure and compare the energy, time, and memory efficiency of such solutions. Ultimately, it is based on such comparisons that we propose a series of efficiency rankings, based on single and multiple criteria. Our results show interesting findings, such as how slower/faster languages can consume less/more energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. We also present a simple way to use our results to provide software engineers and practitioners support in deciding which language to use when energy efficiency is a concern. In addition, we further validate our results and rankings against implementations from a chrestomathy program repository, Rosetta Code., by reproducing our methodology and benchmarking system. This allows us to understand how the results and conclusions from our rigorously and well defined benchmarked programs compare to those based on more representative and real-world implementations. Indeed our results show that the rankings do not change apart from one programming language.},

Who are the people who actually have an interest in improving the sustainability of a specific software system or of the discipline of software engineering itself? And who are the devil's advocates? Having no explicit stakeholders is a problem as improvement of sustainability is challenging without a driving force. An objective that has no stakeholder is not likely to receive sufficient attention to be realized and will eventually disappear. In this paper, we present four approaches of identifying stakeholders for sustainability in a given context: top-down by sustainability dimensions (individual, social, environmental, economic, and technical), by instantiation of a generic list, bottom-up by an organigram, and iteratively by an activity model according to the generic sustainability model. We furthermore analyze the feasibility by a small case study for each approach. As the stakeholders are the key persons determining whether or not any objective is achieved, identifying the stakeholders for sustainability is crucial for successfully implementing sustainability support in a given context. © 2013 IEEE.},

Results: While our data corroborate that complexity metrics can—to a limited degree—explain programmers’ cognition in program comprehension, fMRI allowed us to gain insights into why some code properties are difﬁcult to process. In particular, a code’s textual size drives programmers’ attention, and vocabulary size burdens programmers’ working memory.
Conclusion: Our results provide neuro-scientiﬁc evidence supporting warnings of prior research questioning the validity of code complexity metrics and pin down factors relevant to program comprehension.},

For doing the same we have created same pages in three CMSs to evaluate their page performance. To evaluate the page performance of these CMSs the pages had been hosted on local as well as live server.

Ironically, almost all template engines allow violation of this separation principle, which is the very impetus for HTML template engine development. This situation is due mostly to a lack of formal definition of separation and fear that enforcing separation emasculates a template's power. I show that not only is strict separation a worthy design principle, but that we can enforce separation while providing a potent template engine. I demonstrate my StringTemplate engine, used to build jGuru.com and other commercial sites, at work solving some nontrivial generational tasks.My goal is to formalize the study of template engines, thus, providing a common nomenclature, a means of classifying template generational power, and a way to leverage interesting results from formal language theory. I classify three types of restricted templates analogous to Chomsky's type 1..3 grammar classes and formally define separation including the rules that embody separation.Because this paper provides a clear definition of model-view separation, template engine designers may no longer blindly claim enforcement of separation. Moreover, given theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, programmers no longer have an excuse to entangle model and view.},

Under the demands of cloud computing, datacenters struggle to reduce energy consumption through virtualization and datacenter-infrastructure-management systems. Efficient software energy consumption is increasingly becoming an important nonfunctional requirement for programmers. However, are programmers knowledgeable enough about software energy consumption? Do they base their implementation decision on popular beliefs? Researchers surveyed more than 100 programmers regarding their knowledge of software energy consumption. They found that the programmers had limited knowledge of energy efficiency, lacked knowledge of the best practices to reduce software energy consumption, and were often unsure about how software consumes energy.

Exploring the evolution of the concept—from its 19th-century antecedents through Brundtland to contemporary ‘Panglossian’ interpretations—the paper argues that difﬁculties of implementation are not transient but have deep roots. No conception of sustainable development can be adopted without making fundamental ethical and political choices, but the debate about such choices is nevertheless of great importance. It is argued that we should abandon our search for a singular, consensual deﬁnition of sustainability, but try as best we can to make progress in the absence of consensus.},

	abstract = {Sustainability incorporation within the ﬁeld of Software Engineering is an emerging research area. Sustainability, from an academic perspective, has been addressed to a large extent. However, when it comes to the software industry, the topic has not received much-needed attention. Software, being designed and developed in the industry, can beneﬁt society at large, if sustainability is taken into account by the software professionals during the software design and development process. To develop a sustainable software application, knowledge and awareness about sustainability by professional software developers is one of the key elements. This study is an attempt to examine sustainability knowledge, importance, and support from the perspective of South Asian software professionals. Additionally, this study also proposes sustainability guidelines for certain software applications and also a catalog for the identiﬁcation of sustainability requirements for different software applications. The queries such as ‘What does sustainability mean to a professional software developer?’, ‘How does the software industry identify sustainability requirements?’, ‘How do software developers incorporate the sustainability parameters within software during software development?’, and many other such queries are addressed in this study. To achieve this goal, a survey was carried out among 221 industry practitioners involved in software projects in various application domains such as banking, ﬁnance, and management applications. The results pinpoint that even though sustainability is deemed important by 91\% of practitioners, still there is a lack of understanding regarding sustainability incorporation in software development. A total of 48\% of professionals often misunderstand “Green software” as “sustainable software”. The technical aspect of sustainability is considered most important by professionals (67\%) as well as companies (77\%). One of the key ﬁndings of this study is that 92\% of software practitioners are not able to identify sustainability requirements for software applications. The outcomes of the study may be regarded as an initial attempt towards how sustainability is comprehended in software by the South Asian software industry.},

Software component reusability is an indispensable part of component based software development life cycle (CBSDLC), which consumes a significant amount of organization's resources, that is, time and effort. It is convenient in component based software system (CBSS) to select the most suitable and appropriate software components that provide all the required functionalities. Selecting the most appropriate components is crucial for the success of the entire system. However, decisions regarding software component reusability are often made in an ad hoc manner, which ultimately results in schedule delay and lowers the entire quality system.

Yet such potential savings, as well as the increasing use of other digital services, are predicated upon continued expansion of digital infrastructures. This paper focuses on the phenomenal growth in Internet traﬃc, as a trend with important implications for energy demand. It outlines an agenda to better understand how data demand is changing. Drawing on ﬁndings from our own research in combination with secondary data analysis, we examine the alignment of peak demand for electricity and data. Peaks in data appear to fall later in the evening, reﬂecting the use of online entertainment, but this is far from ﬁxed.

	volume = {12},
	issn = {1748-5908},
	abstract = {Background: Understanding sustainability is one of the significant implementation science challenges. One of the big challenges in researching sustainability is the lack of consistent definitions in the literature. Most implementation studies do not present a definition of sustainability, even when assessing sustainability. The aim of the current study was to systematically develop a comprehensive definition of sustainability based on definitions already used in the literature.
Methods: We searched for knowledge syntheses of sustainability and abstracted sustainability definitions from the articles identified through any relevant systematic and scoping reviews. The constructs in the abstracted sustainability definitions were mapped to an existing definition. The comprehensive definition of sustainability was revised to include emerging constructs.
Results: We identified four knowledge syntheses of sustainability, which identified 209 original articles. Of the 209 articles, 24 (11.5\%) included a definition of sustainability. These definitions were mapped to three constructs from an existing definition, and nine new constructs emerged. We reviewed all constructs and created a revised definition: (1) after a defined period of time, (2) a program, clinical intervention, and/or implementation strategies continue to be delivered and/or (3) individual behavior change (i.e., clinician, patient) is maintained; (4) the program and individual behavior change may evolve or adapt while (5) continuing to produce benefits for individuals/systems. All 24 definitions were remapped to the comprehensive definition (percent agreement among three coders was 94\%). Of the 24 definitions, 17 described the continued delivery of a program (70.8\%), 17 mentioned continued outcomes (70.8\%), 13 mentioned time (54.2\%), 8 addressed the individual maintenance of a behavior change (33.3\%), and 6 described the evolution or adaptation (25.0\%).
Conclusions: We drew from over 200 studies to identify 24 existing definitions of sustainability. Based on these definitions, we identified five key sustainability constructs, which can be used as the basis for future research on sustainability. Our next step is to identify sustainability frameworks and develop a meta-framework using a concept mapping approach to consolidate the factors and considerations across sustainability frameworks.},

A comprehensive research model of OSS success is developed which includes both extrinsic and intrinsic attributes.

ICT enables enhanced manufacturing processes, optimized logistics, solutions supporting environmental protection and solutions facilitating climate change adaptation, for example. The performance of ICT hardware and electronics has increased tremendously. The capabilities of microchips have increased ∼100,000-fold in the past 30 years and the power efficiency has increased a million-fold. Yet, various reports show that the ICT sector increases its carbon footprint and energy consumption, while other sectors are lowering their impact on our planet. Thus, there seems to be an adverse development ongoing where most industry sectors can lower their carbon footprint while the ICT sector increases its consumption. This paper looks at the development of the ICT sector and seeks to understand the current development. We argue that a major reason for the rebound effect we are seeing within the ICT sector is the lack of understanding in energy consumption and the cost pressures of developing digital services. The results are software and services that could be much greener and energy efficient but seem to rather go toward a darker direction. The ICT industry and software engineering needs to do a clear change of course and take accountability of their activities.},

In recent years, developers and researchers have been interested in analyzing, among other things, how energy consump- tion evolves when changes occur from one version to another in any given software. Thus far, the only studies available are theoretical papers that reinforce the idea that maintain- ability may have an influence on energy use, but this needs to be proven empirically, which is the goal of this article. This work presents an empirical study carried out to test whether there is a relationship between the energy consumption and the maintainability of several versions of Redmine. Maintainability has been assessed by means of different measures, such as the number of lines of code, or the complexity of the software, calculated using SonarCloud, and the energy consumption measurements have been captured using the EET device. The results obtained show that the number of lines of code affects both the energy consumption of the processor and the total consumption of the computer where the software is run. It is intended that the results from this work should serve as a basis for the undertaking ofnew empirical studies which will enable the relationship between the software maintainability and the energy efficiency of that software to be better understood.},

	abstract = {Inevitably, the time has come that necessitates software systems to have long lasting social impact and environmental friendliness. Although sustainability related to environmental and social aspects have been well versed in the literature, software sustainability, for the way of development and as final product for use, is still not mature enough. With the increasing role of software crowdsourcing, a new working architecture for software development, in global software development (GSD) settings, has emerged challenges regarding sustainable software development and software sustainability, which are still to be elucidated. Software standards and models exist to assist co-located and global software development; however, seismic changes in the working architecture of software development as software crowdsourcing are highlighting a risk of software failure. Recently, statistics showed that only 30\% of projects are successful, whereas 50\% encounter challenges and the remaining 20\% are absolute failures that implicate a challenge toward software success and its sustainability. This posits questions of how many IEEE and international standard organization standards exist that cover the sustainability aspects in particular to software development and how in-depth the development practices are addressing sustainable aspects in software crowdsourcing? Thus, the aim of this paper is to examine the IEEE software standards with a lens of sustainability to software crowdsourcing. After reviewing the existing IEEE standards related to sustainability, it has been observed that few standards exist which have discussed the importance of sustainability on an abstract level (energy and examining environmental influence by the computers) in software development. Moreover, standards are focusing less attention toward the sustainability of software development in the presence of new envision toward software crowdsourcing. Thus, a lack of any guideline toward sustainable software crowdsourcing is highlighted as one of the limitations in the software standards. This paper contributes to the GSD industry in two folds, first by laying down the importance and theoretical association on and around sustainable crowdsourcing, and second by highlighting that the IEEE standards, inadequacy toward the suppressing phenomena of sustainability in software crowdsourcing, if addressed adequately, can minimize the ripple effect toward software failure.},

Our contribution is to provide a descriptive account of how functional, sentimental and other values associated with devices shape owners’ perceptions and attitudes toward their ‘end of life’, for an expanded range of connected products. By highlighting how perceptions of concepts including convenience, ownership and wastefulness mediate how owners approach the ‘end of life’ of a device, we map the barriers for device owners to engage in more circular practices and highlight opportunities to address them through design. Our study replicates previous findings in the domain, as well as extending them, contributing how the design of modern IoT devices leads to new barriers, opportunities, and considerations for more circular design.

	abstract = {The server power is critical not only for IT equipment power consumption, but also for non-IT power con­ sumption in order to provide a suitable environment for IT equipment. The server power model is essential for thermal environment and energy efficiency. Due to the complication of the effects on power consumption of servers and few power models considering the inlet air temperature, this study firstly built an experimental setup to effectively facilitate the factor analysis. It then evaluated the effects of inlet air temperature and CPU utili­ zation on server power consumption. During the experiment, the inlet air temperature was adjusted between 20 ◦C and 35 ◦C in 5 ◦C increments. Simultaneously, the SPECpower\_ssj2008 was used to change the workload operations per second from 100\% to idle, with a 10\% interval. These measurements were also used in the server’s various CPU power managements. When the inlet air temperature increases from 20 ◦C to 35 ◦C, the highest power increase was 17.60 W for Performance operating mode. Furthermore, in the DAPC and OS operating modes, the server power consumption has a piecewise linear relationship with its CPU temperature, and the function fits well when the CPU temperature is lower than 80 ◦C. For Performance and Workstation operating modes, the server power consumption is proportional to the temperature difference. The measurement-based correlation method employed by this paper can be used to investigate the power consumption model of other type or configured servers. If so, the adaptability of the model can be improved.},

We explore the effect of template use through an eight-year, in-depth field investigation of Rank Xerox (now Xerox Europe). The field investigation covers three sequential transfer efforts in 15 western European countries. The investigation reveals a naturally occurring, repeated-treatment quasi experiment that allows us to test the hypothesis that the use of templates enhances the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. "Observations" in this experiment measure the extent of adoption and performance of the practice at the recipient units. The "treatment" is the use of a template during the transfer.

	isbn = {978-1-4503-4161-5},
	abstract = {In the quest for energy efficiency of Information and Communication Technology, so far research has mostly focused on the role of hardware. However, as hardware technology becomes more sophisticated, the role of software becomes crucial. Recently, the impact of software on energy consumption has been acknowledged as significant by researchers in software engineering. In spite of that, measuring the energy consumption of software has proven to be a challenge, due to the large number of variables that need to be controlled to obtain reliable measurements. Due to cost and time constraints, many software product organizations are unable to effectively measure the energy consumption of software. This prevents them to be in control over the energy efficiency of their products. In this paper, we propose a software energy profiling method to reliably compare the energy consumed by a software product across different releases, from the perspective of a software organization. Our method allows to attribute differences in energy consumption to changes in the software. We validate our profiling method through an empirical experiment on two consecutive releases of a commercial software product. We demonstrate how the method can be applied by organizations and provide an analysis of the software related changes in energy consumption. Our results show that, despite a lack of precise measurements, energy consumption differences between releases of a software product can be quantified down to the level of individual processes. Additionally, the results provide insights on how specific software changes might affect energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Context: Software sustainability is an emergent topic in an age when software is becoming ever more ubiquitous. We, as researchers, have the responsibility of ensuring the dissemination of sustainable software developments in the industry and academic contexts before enacting the creation of a body of knowledge in software sustainability. Our paper presents a review of project descriptions from a project-based course designed in close collaboration with students and external customers. Our master's course is based on four decades of software engineering experience and teaching at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In the scope of this work, we analyzed 45 customers' project proposals over the past three years to identify the social and technical sustainability addressed by the proposals. Objectives: More precisely, we investigated 1) how software social sustainability topics are introduced from customers' project descriptions, 2) how software technical sustainability is addressed from customers' project descriptions, and 3) the extent to which software environmental and economical sustainability is addressed from customers' project descriptions. Method: We conducted a deductive thematic analysis utilizing open coding of customers' project descriptions. Results: We found that customers' project descriptions moderately addressed social sustainability for specific target groups. Technical sustainability is also addressed by a little more than half of the overall projects. However, we observed that no effort was made to address environmental and economic sustainability. Contribution: The study's overall findings contribute to the future improvement of the course and help inform customers about prospective socially relevant project proposals.},

	volume = {85},
	abstract = {A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous pri-mary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist. Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method: We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results: We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, em-bedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied stan-dardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion: SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can ben-efit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008.},

	abstract = {The increase in computational capability of low-power Arm architectures has seen them diversify from their more traditional domain of portable battery powered devices into data center servers, personal computers, and even Supercomputers. Thus, managed languages (Java, Javascript, etc.) that require a managed runtime environment (MRE) need to be ported to the Arm architecture, requiring an understanding of different design tradeoffs.
            This article studies how the lack of strong hardware support for Self Modifying Code (SMC) in low-power architectures (e.g., absence of cache coherence between instruction cache and data caches), affects Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and runtime behavior in MREs. Specifically, we focus on the implementation and treatment of call-sites, that must maintain code consistency in the face of concurrent execution and modification to redirect control (patching) by the MRE. The lack of coherence, is compounded with the maximum distance (reach of) a call-site can jump to as the reach is more constrained (smaller distance) in Arm when compared with Intel/AMD. We present four different robust implementations for call-sites and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in the absence of strong hardware support for SMC. Finally, we evaluate each approach using a microbenchmark, further evaluating the best three techniques using three JVM benchmark suites and the open source MaxineVM showcasing performance differences up to 12\%. Based on these observations, we propose extending code-cache partitioning strategies for JIT compiled code to encourage more efficient local branching for architectures with limited direct branch ranges.},

Findings suggest that digital platforms strengthen the livestock system through connecting system actors, improving coordination, and enabling transactions. However, these platforms are fraught with hidden complexities often invisible to users and can worsen prevailing conditions.

The purpose of this work is to define and evaluate the current trends of the literature concerned with the sustainability of bitcoin, considering the environmental impacts, social issues and economic aspects. From the analysis it emerges that the transition of the whole monetary system in the new cryptocurrency will result in an unacceptable amount of energy consumed to mine new bitcoins and to maintain the entire virtual monetary system, and probably bitcoin will remain a niche currency. Blockchain, which is the base for a distributed and democratically-sustained public ledger of the transactions, could foster new and challenging opportunities. Sharing the framework of medical data, energy generation and distribution in micro-grids at the citizen level, block-stack and new state-driven cryptocurrencies, may benefit from the wide spread of blockchain-based transactions.

We ran a set of structured experiments with 24 professional pair programmers. One group developed a small Java program using TDD while the other (control group), used a waterfall-like approach. Experimental results, subject to external validity concerns, tend to indicate that TDD programmers produce higher quality code because they passed 18\% more functional black-box test cases. However, the TDD programmers took 16\% more time. Statistical analysis of the results showed that a moderate statistical correlation existed between time spent and the resulting quality. Lastly, the programmers in the control group often did not write the required automated test cases after completing their code. Hence it could be perceived that waterfall-like approaches do not encourage adequate testing. This intuitive observation supports the perception that TDD has the potential for increasing the level of unit testing in the software industry.},

For ICT’s future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts’ projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and ﬁnd that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets.

By bundling a software product with delivery and maintenance service, SaaS providers can effectively differentiate their products with traditional shrink-wrap software (SWS). This research uses a game theoretical approach to examine short- and long-term competition between SaaS and SWS providers. We analyze the factors that affect equilibrium outcomes, including user implementation costs, SaaS provider’s operation efﬁciency, and quality improvement over time. Bundling software with service lowers software implementation cost for users, and our results suggest that it increases equilibrium prices. In providing software services, SaaS providers have to incur signiﬁcant operation cost. In the long run, service operation cost may signiﬁcantly affect SaaS ﬁrm’s ability to improve its software quality.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that the terms ‘Sustainable artificial intelligence (AI)’ in general and ‘Sustainability of AI’ in particular are overused to the extent that they have lost their meaning. The AI for (social) good movement is a manifestation of this trend in which almost any application used in the context of healthcare or agriculture can be classified as AI for good regardless of whether such applications have been evaluated from a broader perspective. In this paper, we aim to create a common understanding of what the ‘AI for Sustainability’ movement ought to mean. We distinguish between two possible AI for Sustainability applications, namely those that fulfill the necessary conditions and those that fulfill the sufficient conditions. The former are purely predictive systems that serve as information providers. The latter are directly involved in an activity that contributes to a sustainability goal. We argue that taking action is a key element in distinguishing between these two application groups, as inaction is the key bottleneck in effectively tackling climate change. Furthermore, we question how effective the use of AI applications can be for sustainability when the systems themselves are inherently unsustainable. Hence, AI for Sustainability should include both an action that contributes to a sustainable end goal as well as an investigation of the sustainability issues of the AI system itself. Following that, Sustainable AI research can be on a gradient: AI in an application domain, AI towards sustainability, and AI for Sustainability.},

The present study delves into the many aspects of software sustainability, emphasizing architectural choices, sustainability measurements, and the use of software in scholarly investigations. It presents the idea of "sustainability debt," which results from poor design decisions and lowers the calibre of software. The significance of gathering and organizing architectural knowledge (AK) is covered in the article as a means of reducing this debt and enhancing decision-making. The paper discusses metrics for code complexity and maintainability as well as architectural metrics for modularity and design smells that are used to assess software sustainability at various abstraction levels. It also looks at new architectural knowledge measures that evaluate how long-lasting design choices are and how they affect the development of software. The study also emphasizes the importance of software in research and the problems associated with a lack of recognition and training in this area. It examines programs like the Software Sustainability Institute's Open Call for Projects and its endeavours to advance software practices and talent development. To sum up, attaining software sustainability requires a thorough strategy that incorporates strategic architectural choices, efficient use of metrics, and continuous enhancements in software processes. The study urges ongoing efforts to tackle these issues in order to maintain software systems' dependability and support long-term objectives for research and development.},

We choose NGINX as reverse proxy caching for optimizing this single low-end LAMP server. The reason why we do not use NGINX as the web server, despite the fact that NGINX has better performance by many reviews, is because some popular web applications and framework only support Apache. This dependency force the startup owner to use Apache rather than NGINX as the web server. To evaluate the performance of this infrastructure, we use WordPress as the web content and then test it using two test. First, we test the server using 102 concurrent connections, then we increase it to 408 concurrent connections. Those scenarios have tested on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosted in DigitalOcean which has single 2.00 GHz CPU and 512 of RAM that cost only USD 5 per month. Experiment result shows that the proposed architecture can reduce page loading time up to 96\%, saving CPU load up to 99\% and saving memory usage up to 28\%. We conclude that using NGINX as a reverse proxy on LAMP server is a good alternative solution to optimize the performance of the web server.},

Background Since sustainability became a challenge in software engineering, researchers mainly from requirements engineering and software architecture communities have contributed to defining the basis of the notion of sustainability-aware software. Problem Despite these valuable efforts, the assessment and design based on the notion of sustainability as a software quality is still poorly understood. There is no consensus on which sustainability requirements should be considered. Aim and Method To fill this gap, a survey was designed with a double objective: i) determine to which extent quality requirements contribute to the sustainability of software-intensive systems; and ii) identify direct dependencies among the sustainability dimensions. The survey involved different target audiences (e.g. software architects, ICT practitioners with expertise in Sustainability). We evaluated the perceived importance/relevance of each sustainability dimension, and the perceived usefulness of exploiting a sustainability model in different software engineering activities.

IE Method: We performed an exploratory case study by conducting interviews, group discussions, and reviewing company documentation to investigate software reuse in the context of contemporary SE practices in the case company.
Results: The results indicate that the development for reuse in contemporary SE practices incurs additional coordination, among other costs. Development with reuse led to relatively fewer additional costs and resulted in several benefits such as better product quality and less development and delivery time. Ownership of reusable assets is challenging in contemporary SE practice. InnerSource practices may help mitigate the top perceived challenges: discoverability and ownership of the reusable assets, knowledge sharing and V reuse measurement.
Conclusion: Reuse in contemporary SE practices is not without additional costs and challenges. However, the practitioners perceive costs as investments that benefit the company in the long run.},

The authors implemented a large-scale randomized field experiment with an app firm to test the causal effects of such pricing and product design strategies. Results show that both soft landing and exclusive secondary offerings decrease existing app users? willingness to subscribe, but there is a positive interaction between these two strategies on subscriptions. The authors propose a theoretical framework, discuss potential mechanisms that might be at play, and conduct robustness checks to rule out several alternative explanations. A customer survey by the firm and an experiment on Prolific provide further support for the theoretical mechanism. To assess generalizability, the authors conducted a second field experiment and obtained consistent results. They also report the results from the actual implementation of the best-performing strategy by the firm.

              To foster a sustainable society within a sustainable environment, we must dramatically reshape our work and consumption activities, most of which are facilitated through software. Yet, most software engineers hardly consider the effects on the sustainability of the IT products and services they deliver. This issue is exacerbated by a lack of methods and tools for this purpose.

              Despite the practical need for methods and tools that explicitly support consideration of the effects that IT products and services have on the sustainability of their intended environments, such methods and tools remain largely unavailable. Thus, urgent research is needed to understand how to design such tools for the IT community properly.

In this paper, we aim at assessing the global carbon footprint of the overall ICT industry, including the contribution from the main consumer devices, the data centers and communication networks, and compare it with the to the total worldwide GHGE. We conduct a detailed and rigorous analysis of the ICT global carbon footprint, including both the production and the operational energy of ICT devices, as well as the operational energy for the supporting ICT infrastructure. We then compare this contribution to the global 2016-level GHGE. We have found that, if unchecked, ICT GHGE relative contribution could grow from roughly 1e1.6\% in 2007 to exceed 14\% of the 2016-level worldwide GHGE by 2040, accounting for more than half of the current relative contribution of the whole transportation sector. Our study also highlights the contribution of smart phones and shows that by 2020, the footprint of smart phones alone would surpass the individual contribution of desktops, laptops and displays. Finally, we offer some actionable recommendations on how to mitigate and curb the ICT explosive GHGE footprint, through a combination of renewable energy use, tax policies, managerial actions and alternative business models.},

The Raspberry Pi has often been referred as a computer designed to change the world since it is capable to do most things that a desktop computer can do. The growing concern is that all these computers utilize power in order to operate thereby turning ICT into a power drainer. The diverse functionalities present in modern computers including communication and web browsing, among others, were found to be important components that affect the power consumption of such devices.

	abstract = {Sustainability has emerged as a broad concern for society. Many engineering disciplines have been grappling with challenges in how we sustain technical, social and ecological systems. In the software engineering community, for example, maintainability has been a concern for a long time. But too often, these issues are treated in isolation from one another. Misperceptions among practitioners and research communities persist, rooted in a lack of coherent understanding of sustainability, and how it relates to software systems research and practice. This article presents a cross-disciplinary initiative to create a common ground and a point of reference for the global community of research and practice in software and sustainability, to be used for effectively communicating key issues, goals, values and principles of sustainability design for software-intensive systems.The centrepiece of this effort is the Karlskrona Manifesto for Sustainability Design, a vehicle for a much needed conversation about sustainability within and beyond the software community, and an articulation of the fundamental principles underpinning design choices that affect sustainability. We describe the motivation for developing this manifesto, including some considerations of the genre of the manifesto as well as the dynamics of its creation. We illustrate the collaborative reflective writing process and present the current edition of the manifesto itself. We assess immediate implications and applications of the articulated principles, compare these to current practice, and suggest future steps.},

	abstract = {Recently, energy-eﬃcient computing has become a major interest, both in the mobile and IT sectors. With the advent of multi-core processors and their energy-saving mechanisms, there is a necessity to model their power consumption. The existing models for multi-core processors are based on the assumption that the power consumption of multiple cores performing parallel computations is equal to the sum of the power of each of those active cores. In this paper, we analyze this assumption and show that it leads to lack of accuracy when applied to modern processors such as quad-core. Based on our analysis, we present a methodology for estimating the power consumption of multi-core processors. Unlike existing models, we take into account resource sharing and power saving mechanisms. We show that our approach provides an accuracy within a maximum error of 5\%.},

Method: Our report is based on data from two studies we conducted in the past. Results: Contacting developers over public media proved to be the most eﬀective and eﬃcient sampling strategy. However, we not only describe the perspective of researchers who are interested in reaching goals like a large number of participants or a high response rate, but we also shed light onto ethical implications of diﬀerent sampling strategies. We present one speciﬁc ethical guideline and point to debates in other research communities to start a discussion in the software engineering research community about which sampling strategies should be considered ethical.},

	abstract = {Highlights  Presents a process-line for selecting software asset origins and components.  Process-line helps decision-makers to build their decisions-making process.  The process-line is evaluated through five case studies in three companies.  The practitioners did not perceive any activity to be missing in the process-line.  A sub-set of activities were followed by the companies without any specific order. Abstract Selecting sourcing options for software assets and components is an important process that helps companies to gain and keep their competitive advantage. The sourcing options include: in-house, COTS, open source and outsourcing. The objective of this paper is to further refine, extend and validate a solution presented in our previous work. The refinement includes a set of decision-making activities, which are described in the form of a process-line that can be used by decision-makers to build their specific decision-making process. We conducted five case studies in three companies to validate the coverage of the set of decision-making activities. The solution in our previous work was validated in two cases in the first two companies. In the validation, it was observed that no activity in the proposed set was perceived to be missing, although not all activities were conducted and the activities that were conducted were not executed in a specific order. Therefore, the refinement of the solution into a process-line approach increases the flexibility and hence it is better in capturing the differences in the decision-making processes observed in the case studies. The applicability of the process-line was then validated in three case studies in a third company.},

Method: A systematic review study of peer-reviewed literature has been conducted. Results: In total we included 24 primary studies. The component origins compared were mainly focused on in-house vs. COTS and COTS vs. OSS. We identified 11 factors affecting or influencing the decision to select a component origin. When component origins were compared, there was little evidence on the relative (either positive or negative) effect of a component origin on the factor. Most of the solutions were proposed for in-house vs. COTS selection and time, cost and reliability were the most considered factors in the solutions. Optimization models were the most commonly proposed technique used in the solutions. Conclusion: The topic of choosing component origins is a green field for research, and in great need of empirical comparisons between the component origins, as well of how to decide between different combinations of them.},

	abstract = {A code generator is a program translating an input model into code. In this paper we focus on template-based code generators in the context of the model view controller architecture (MVC). The language in which the code generator is written is known as a metalanguage in the code generation parlance. The metalanguage should be, on the one side, expressive enough to be of practical value, and, on the other side, restricted enough to enforce the separation between the view and the model, according to the MVC. In this paper we advocate the notion of unparser-complete metalanguages as providing the right level of expressivity. An unparsercomplete metalanguage is capable of expressing an unparser, a code generator that translates any legal abstract syntax tree into an equivalent sentence of the corresponding context-free language. A metalanguage not able to express an unparser will fail to produce all sentences belonging to the corresponding context-free language. A metalanguage able to express more than an unparser will also be able to implement code violating the model/view separation. We further show that a metalanguage with the power of a linear deterministic tree-to-string transducer is unparser-complete. Moreover, this metalanguage has been successfully applied in a nontrivial case study where an existing code generator is refactored using templates.},

In this paper, we explain a procedure for the creation of an energy consumption model of SBCs based on the usage of its components. We apply the procedure on a Raspberry PI 2 model B to test the model with a set of real applications. The results demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach and show that estimated consumption values on our device have an average error of 2.2\%, which is a good approximation without using external and expensive measuring devices.},

They require that an adversary has access to an identical experimental device that he can program to his choosing. The success of these attacks in such constraining situations is due manner in which noise within each sample is handled. In contrast to previous approaches which viewed noise as a hindrance that had to be reduced or eliminated, our approach focuses on precisely modeling noise, and using this to fully extract information present in a single sample. We describe in detail how an implementation of RC4, not amenable to techniques such as SPA and DPA, can easily be broken using template attacks with a single sample. Other applications include attacks on certain DES implementations which use DPA-resistant hardware and certain SSL accelerators which can be attacked by monitoring electromagnetic emanations from an RSA operation even from distances of fifteen feet.},

Methods: We conducted a mixed-method empirical analysis from two perspectives; software (data mining in 12 Apache projects) and developers’ views (a survey of 62 software practitioners).
Results: Our findings show that: (1) test smell is associated with energy consumption in software testing. Specifically, the smelly part of a test case consumes more energy compared to the non-smelly part. (2) certain test smells are more energy-hungry than others, (3) refactored test cases tend to consume less energy than their smelly counterparts, and (4) most developers (45\% of the survey respondents) lack knowledge about test smells’ impact on energy consumption.
Conclusion: Based on the results, we emphasize raising developers awareness regarding the impact of test smells on energy consumption. Additionally we present several observations that can direct future research and developments.},

We found that the challenges of publishing interdisciplinary research in SE can be divided into topic-related and reviewingrelated challenges. Furthermore, while our initial focus was on publishing interdisciplinary research, the impact of current reviewing practices on marginalized groups emerged from our data, as we found that marginalized groups are more likely to receive negative feedback. In addition, we found that experienced researchers are less likely to change their research direction due to feedback they receive. To address the identified challenges, our participants emphasize the importance of highlighting the impact and value of interdisciplinary work for SE, collaborating with experienced researchers, and establishing clearer submission guidelines and new interdisciplinary SE publication venues. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the current state of the SE research community and how we could better support interdisciplinary research in our field.},

This study investigates the ethical challenges and complexities inherent in responsible software engineering for AI, underscoring the need for practical, scenariodriven operational guidelines. Given the complexity of AI and the relative inexperience of professionals in this rapidly evolving field, continuous learning and market adaptation are crucial. Through qualitative interviews with seven practitioners (conducted until saturation), quantitative surveys of 51 practitioners and static validation of results with four industry experts in AI, this study explores how personal values, emerging roles, and awareness of AI’s societal impact influence responsible decision-making in responsible software engineering for AI. A key finding is the gap between the current state of the art and actual practice in responsible software engineering for AI, particularly in the failure to operationalize ethical and responsible decision-making within the software engineering life cycle for AI. While ethical issues in responsible software engineering for AI largely mirror those found in broader software engineering process, the study highlights a distinct lack of operational frameworks and resources to guide responsible software engineering practices for AI effectively. The results reveal that current ethical guidelines are insufficiently implemented at the operational level, reinforcing the complexity of embedding ethics throughout the software engineering life cycle. The study concludes that interdisciplinary collaboration, H-shaped competencies (Ethical-Technical dual competence), and a strong organizational culture of ethics are critical for fostering responsible software engineering practices for AI, with a particular focus on transparency and accountability.},

	abstract = {We present template attacks, the strongest form of side channel attack possible in an information theoretic sense. These attacks can break implementations and countermeasures whose security is dependent on the assumption that an adversary cannot obtain more than one or a limited number of side channel samples. They require that an adversary has access to an identical experimental device that he can program to his choosing. The success of these attacks in such constraining situations is due manner in which noise within each sample is handled. In contrast to previous approaches which viewed noise as a hindrance that had to be reduced or eliminated, our approach focuses on precisely modeling noise, and using this to fully extract information present in a single sample. We describe in detail how an implementation of RC4, not amenable to techniques such as SPA and DPA, can easily be broken using template attacks with a single sample. Other applications include attacks on certain DES implementations which use DPA-resistant hardware and certain SSL accelerators which can be attacked by monitoring electromagnetic emanations from an RSA operation even from distances of fifteen feet.},

	abstract = {Information Technology (IT) has a critical role in supporting sustainable development. However, there are also various ways in which IT contributes negatively to it. Despite the ever-growing need for IT professionals qualified to take on these challenges, education in sustainability and IT has so far been lacking. IT students need an understanding of the far-reaching implications of IT, and to acknowledge their responsibility for the systems they create, to actively contribute to positive change. To address this need, our research explores how collaborative games can be utilized as a tool to develop IT students’ knowledge and perception of sustainability and its connection with IT. Previous research has found the use of games to teach sustainability promising, and in this paper, we present SustainIT, a 3D collaborative game for IT students. In SustainIT, the players communicate across the past and future to make more sustainable decisions for an IT company. The learning goals of the game are to promote systems thinking, an understanding of the connection between sustainability and IT, and to challenge existing perceptions. Focus has been put on finding effective game elements to promote learning and engagement to support these learning outcomes. In the paper we present the design and the evaluation of the game. The final prototype was evaluated by an expert in sustainability in IT education, and a group of students within the target group. The overall evaluation was positive, with the game being evaluated as relevant and interesting. However, the evaluation also pointed out some challenges with the integration of background information about sustainability into the game. Our findings can inform the development of games aimed at cultivating the understanding of the impacts of IT on sustainability.},

	abstract = {Model transformations are a major instrument of model-driven software development. Especially in declarative trans-formation approaches, the structuring of transformations depends to a large extent on the structure of the source models and the generated artefacts. In many cases, similar code is written for transformations that deal with the same source or target metamodel. Writing such transformations can be simplified significantly if re-occurring parts within the transformation rules can be specified in a reusable way. Current approaches to transformation development include means for transformation reuse as well as inheritance. How-ever, modularisation along the boundaries of different parts of domain metamodels is still lacking. Furthermore, the pos-sibilities to reuse transformation fragments that re-occur in multiple transformations is limited. In this paper, we in-troduce domain-specific templates for refinement transfor-mations with well-defined variation points. Transformation templates are based on known design patterns and enable a modular specification of refinement transformations and thus yield a simpler definition of transformations that can be grasped more easily and developed more efficiently. In addition, we present a real-world case study of transforma-tion templates in the context of component based software architectures. The case study gives insight into the applica-tion of the presented approach.},

Results. Significant differences emerged across configurations. CUDA execution provider configurations outperformed CPU execution provider configurations in both energy consumption and execution time. Among the configurations, TORCH paired with CUDA demonstrated the greatest energy efficiency, achieving energy savings from 37.99\% up to 89.16\% compared to other serving configurations. Similarly, optimized runtime engines like ONNX with the CPU execution provider achieved from 8.98\% up to 72.04\% energy savings within CPU-based configurations. Also, TORCH paired with CUDA exhibited efficient computing-resource utilization.
Conclusions. Serving configuration choice significantly impacts energy efficiency. While further research is needed, we recommend the above configurations best suited to software engineers’ requirements for enhancing serving efficiency in energy and performance.},

The need for such an evaluation model is pressing given the sharp increase in energy demand generated by the ICT industry. In particular, we need to get in control of our software applications since they play a key role in driving the consumption of energy. This paper proposes ME 3 SA, a Model for Evaluating the Energy Efficiency of Software Applications. ME 3 SA provides a practical breakdown of energy efficiency into measurements that can be applied to software applications in relation to the quantity of work they deliver. This approach makes it possible to measure and control energy efficiency similar to other software qualities such as performance efficiency or maintainability. Furthermore, we report on a case study in which the model was applied to an operational software system of the Software Improvement Group (SIG), a software advisory firm based in the Netherlands. The case study provides evidence that the proposed model is able to identify energy consumption hotspots and efficiency bottlenecks within software applications.},

Traditionally, energy efficiency research has focused on reducing energy consumption at the hardware level.

              Our analysis shows that related work in this area has focused mainly on the implementation and verification phases of the software development lifecycle. Existing work shows that the use of parallel and approximate programming, source code analyzers, efficient data structures, coding practices, and specific programming languages can significantly increase energy efficiency.

There is a lot of research in the literature to address different sets of these activities by different means. Specifically, several tools have already tackled such technical debt identification problems. However, only a few studies empirically assessed those tools. Method: In this article, we carried a multi-method research. We first surveyed the literature for the technical debt tools available and then we evaluated two of them, which aim at identification of self-admitted technical debt. They are named eXcomment e DebtHunter. Results: We found 97 tools employing different approaches to support technical debt life cycle management. Most of them (59\%) address only the high level task of management, instead of actually identify and pay the debt. Additionally, as for our empirical evaluation of tools, our results show that DebtHunter found only 7\% of debt identified by eXcomment. In the other way around, eXcomment found 19.9\% the debt found by DebtHunter. Besides, both tools have low levels of precision and recall. Conclusion: It is hard to find technical debt through comments. Both tools can find indicators of debt items, however they struggle on the precision and recall. In fact, although eXcomment and DebtHunter diverge on the amount of debt identified, they seem to converge with regard to the type of debt present in the system under evaluation.},

With this study, our aim is to identify quality attribute (QA) trade-offs at the software architecture level and quantify the related sustainability impact. To this aim we present an improved version of the Sustainability Impact Score (SIS), building on our previous work. The SIS facilitates the identification and quantification of trade-offs in terms of their sustainability impact, leveraging a risk- and importancebased prioritization mechanism. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to an industrial case study involving a multimodel framework for integrated decision-making in the energy sector. Our study reveals that technical quality concerns have significant, often unrecognized impacts across sustainability dimensions. The SIS coupled with QA trade-offs can help practitioners make informed decisions that align with their sustainability goals.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Human resource factors such as job stress and job satisfaction are important topics in both the science and practice of software development. However, existing studies use different conceptualizations of stress. In this paper, a new theoretical perspective on stress, the effort-reward imbalance framework, is presented and empirically investigated. According to this framework, stress results from an imbalance between perceived effort and reward. A moderated mediation model is proposed that conceptualizes stress as a mediator in explaining the relationship between agility (measured by eight agile practices) (independent variable) and developers' job satisfaction (dependent variable). In addition, the theoretical model proposes that overcommitment, a personality trait, moderates the relationship between agility and stress. Based on a sample of N = 178 software developers in Austria, the data confirm the model. The results show that agility indirectly increases job satisfaction via reduced stress perceptions. There was no significant direct effect of agility on job satisfaction. However, looking specifically at the effort and reward components, a stress-reducing effect of agility and a consequent satisfaction-enhancing effect were observed, primarily because the use of an agile approach increases developers' reward perceptions. Furthermore, it was found that the agile practices of requirements change and customer relation have a stress-increasing effect, while the other six practices (pair programming, continuous integration, refactoring, unit testing, collective ownership, coding standards) have a stress-reducing effect. However, since the results show that agility has an overall stress-reducing effect, this means that the unfavorable influence of requirements change and customer relationship on stress is overcompensated by the other six practices, predominantly via their positive influence on reward perceptions. Finally, the results show that developers with high levels of overcommitment experience a reduced benefit from agility.},

An indispensable activity in software development is testing, which is known to be very costly in terms of time and effort. On top of this, a recent study by Zaidman has shown that software testing can be a voracious energy consumer as well. In this work we introduce the very concept of energy-aware testing as the adoption of strategies designed to reduce the energy consumption of existing practices. We discuss some possible strategies and, as an example, we conduct a first study of an energy-aware variant of a simple similarity-based test prioritization approach considering both energy consumption and test suite effectiveness, which provides evidence of perceptible savings. We encourage future research in energy-aware software testing that needs to address further studies and to think up more strategies.},

Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups and asked to prioritize a backlog of prosocial, neutral, and antisocial user stories for a shopping mall’s digital screen display and facial recognition software. Participants received either persona models, a stakeholder map, both, or neither. We compared the differences in prioritization levels assigned to prosocial and antisocial user stories using Cumulative Link Mixed Model regression. Results: Participants who received persona models gave significantly lower priorities to antisocial user stories but no significant difference was evident for prosocial user stories. The effects of the stakeholder map were not significant. The interaction effects were not significant. Conclusion: Providing aspiring software professionals with well-crafted persona models causes them to de-prioritize antisocial software features. The impact of persona modelling on sustainable software development therefore warrants further study with more experience professionals. Moreover, the novel methodological strategy of assessing social sustainability behavior through backlog prioritization appears feasible in lab-based settings.},

While numerous tools are available to assess softwareenvironmental footprint post-development, few focus on sustainability during the software design phase. To address this gap, we propose EcoDocSense, a framework that supports engineers to evaluate the sustainability of a software design at design time. Utilizing Large Language Models fine-tuned on a catalog of green software patterns, EcoDocSense analyzes software architecture documents to generate sustainability reports, assessing alignment with green software practices to minimize carbon emissions and recommending improvements. As one of the first frameworks targeting sustainability at the design stage, EcoDoc Sense represents a significant advancement, though opportunities remain for further enhancement. In future we plan to extend EcoDocSense’s applicability to a variety of architectural types and documents as well as to provide the capability to estimate carbon emissions.},

Method: We conduct a literature review comprising 91 papers awarded with the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering. Data is extracted and analyzed by considering six main facets of threats to validity, e.g., their explicit documentation, categorization, discussion of limitations, and trade-offs. Results: Results corroborate current critiques to the threats management state of the art. Threats result to be seldom discussed in depth, and are mostly considered as an enforced afterthought rather than an active concern of the research design and execution.

	abstract = {The research was conducted through a systematic literature review. The review protocol included two evaluation rounds and was designed to find the most relevant sources regarding environmental sustainability and software development process. The final study selection included 32 articles from which a total of 108 sustainability factors were identified and categorized into 14 recurring themes. The literature review show that sustainability factors in current literature span throughout all life cycle phases, from planning to retirement. The earlier life cycle phases are more closely examined in terms of number and influence of the sustainability factors. The sustainability factors include both process-level guidelines as well as code-level practices, well demonstrated by the two most prominent themes: sustainable project management and code-level characteristics. Key finding of this thesis is that environmental sustainability practices should be integrated into the software development process as an additional layer, rather than as entirely new concepts. Integrating sustainability into the development process includes considering sustainability a key requirement and a quality attribute, as well as adding sustainability assessment into the project management and introducing a sustainability stakeholder into software projects. Identifying sustainability factors and their relevance to life cycle phases helps create awareness of existing measures that can be taken to embed environmental sustainability into software development process. However, further empiric research is required to provide further information about the effectiveness of various sustainability practices.},

	abstract = {Background: The rapid growth of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector has led to significant increases in energy consumption, raising concerns about the environmental impact of software development. Green coding practices have emerged as a potential solution, aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of software by optimizing code for energy efficiency.
Objectives: This study explores how green coding practices are perceived and implemented in the software development industry, identifies the barriers developers face in adopting these practices, and proposes strategies to overcome these challenges.
Methods: A qualitative, case study approach was employed, involving semi-structured interviews with developers from eight companies across various sectors. Thematic analysis was used to identify recurring themes and barriers, and NVivo software facilitated the data coding and analysis process.
Results: The findings reveal that while developers often engage in practices aligned with green coding, there is a widespread lack of awareness and formal organizational support. Key barriers include the absence of formal guidelines, lack of awareness, and a lack of energy monitoring tools. Despite these challenges, developers emphasize the importance of education, leadership advocacy, and the standardization of green coding practices to promote sustainability.
Conclusions: The study highlights the need for industry-wide education, formal guidelines, and the development of energy monitoring tools to facilitate the adoption of green coding practices. By addressing these barriers, companies can significantly reduce their environmental impact, contributing to broader sustainability goals.},

Our results highlight the practical challenges, recommendations, and benefits of implementing sustainability practices in real-world organizational settings. Lack of sustainability prioritization, knowledge awareness, measurement tools, scarce resources, and organizational culture are the key challenge areas. By balancing priorities, the investment in sustainability education and tool support coupled with cultural change and resource-rich incentivization programs can motivate practitioners to use sustainability practices.

	abstract = {Objective: Designing a software-intensive sustainable energy management system requires considering technical, environmental, social, and economic factors. This helps evaluate an EnMS’s overall impact and improve its design. We proposed EnSAF for efficient utilization of the energy incurred for the design of sustainability-aware EnMSs.
Method: In this work, EnMSs in diverse use cases were selected and analyzed in terms of technical, social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability in collaboration with various stakeholders. The set of application-specific design concerns and Quality Attributes (QAs) were addressed by the Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) toolkit. The resultant SAF instances of each EnMS, derived through the analysis and discussion with the stakeholders, were then analyzed to advocate the DMs and SQ model for generic EnMSs.
Results: This study demonstrated the following outcomes (i) technical concerns dominate the existing EnMSs (ii) integration of renewable energy resources reduces dependency to the main power grid and nurtures a sustainable environment by diminishing carbon footprint, and minimizing payback time, in the economic dimension; (iii) extant definitions of quality attributes need significant scrutiny and updates apropos of objectives of EnMSs
Conclusion: The SAF toolkit was found to be deficient in the representation of relevant design concerns and quality attributes concomitant with sustainable EnMS. Prevailing DMs are inept to factor in stakeholder’s concerns, as the model is ill-equipped to account for spatio-temporal representation of QAs. Pursuant to the insights from the 4 SAF instances, a generic framework, EnSAF, is proposed to tackle the relevant concerns apropos of EnMS sustainability. This work proposed a representation of DMs in the SAF toolkit specifically for sustainability-aware EnMS.},

	abstract = {Green Software Engineering (GSE) is emerging as a key enabler in improving the efficiency of renewable energy systems and fostering sustainable development. As the global shift towards clean energy accelerates, the role of software in optimizing energy systems has become increasingly significant. GSE, a discipline focused on minimizing the environmental impact of software development and operation, can act as a catalyst for enhancing the performance of renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and hydropower. By optimizing algorithms, improving data management, and reducing the computational footprint, green software can drive down energy consumption in smart grids, data centers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, making renewable energy systems more efficient. Moreover, GSE supports the adoption of low-power programming techniques and sustainable cloud computing, which are essential in managing large-scale renewable energy infrastructures. The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence into GSE can further boost predictive maintenance, resource allocation, and energy distribution, thus reducing waste and enhancing the stability of renewable energy networks. In addition, GSE principles align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to affordable clean energy, responsible consumption, and climate action. This paper explores the synergies between Green Software Engineering and renewable energy, demonstrating how GSE practices contribute to reducing carbon footprints, enhancing energy efficiency, and driving sustainable development. It also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between software engineers, energy experts, and policymakers to create a future where technology not only supports economic growth but also minimizes environmental impact.},

Therefore, integrating sustainability into software architecture is crucial for the long-term viability of organizations. In this study, we explore how new sustainability concerns can be effectively tackled within software architecture, especially when established architecture standards are followed. We present two main contributions derived from an industrial case study. First, we present the extension of existing architecture views, called decision maps, to trace the involvement of architecture standards. Such extension supports architects through informed decision making by integrating sustainability aspects while adhering to architecture standards. Second, we propose a set of key performance indicators to monitor the ongoing application of these standards and assess their impact on the software architecture and its sustainability over time. Our findings provide valuable insights and instruments for experts to first assess sustainability within the constraints of architecture standards, and then monitor their sustainability impact. This will help to meet regulatory requirements and align software design with strategic sustainability goals. We provide tangible guiding steps to improve sustainability awareness and decision-making.},

	abstract = {This is a full research paper. Computer science is a young, dynamic and rapidly evolving discipline. Content knowledge has been the focus for higher education in the subject but none-technical skills have gained increasing attention. To develop competence in the discipline, dispositions are also needed, this aspect is however new to computer science education. This study explores novice computer science students’ perceptions of essential competencies for success in the field. Reflective texts from 133 students at two Swedish universities collected during their first week have been qualitatively analysed using the Competency learning framework (CoLeaF) and tested for statistically significant differences within the student group using a Chi-Square analysis. CoLeaF describes a competence in terms of its dispositional, skill and knowledge elements. Students were primarily focusing on disposition and skill elements. Motivation, perseverance and creativity were the most common dispositions and skills related to problem solving and logic were most prominent, followed by collaboration and communication. Math was the predominant knowledge element reflected on, particularly by students with more prior programming experience. Differences emerged between legal genders, with females emphasizing curiosity, being structured, having a goal, and being challenged more than males. The study highlights a need for CS education to cultivate both technical expertise and non-technical qualities alongside a deeper understanding of ethical and societal responsibilities within the field.},

	abstract = {It’s no secret that AI systems come with a significant environmental cost. This raises the question: What are the roles and responsibilities of computing professionals regarding the sustainability of AI? Informed by a year-long informal literature review on the subject, we employ stakeholder identification, analysis, and mapping to highlight the complex and interconnected roles that five major stakeholder groups (industry, practitioners, regulatory, advocacy, and the general public) play in the sustainability of AI. Swapping the traditional final step of stakeholder methods (stakeholder engagement) for entanglement, we demonstrate the inherent entwinement of choices made with regard to the development and maintenance of AI systems and the people who impact (or are impacted by) these choices. This entanglement should be understood as a system of human and non-human agents, with the implications of each choice ricocheting into the use of natural resources and climate implications. We argue that computing professionals (AI-focused or not) may belong to multiple stakeholder groups, and that we all have multiple roles to play in the sustainability of AI. Further, we argue that the nature of regulation in this domain will look unlike others in environmental preservation (e.g., legislation around water contaminants). As a result, we call for ongoing, flexible bodies and policies to move towards the regulation of AI from a sustainability angle, as well as suggest ways in which individual computing professionals can contribute to fighting the environmental and climate effects of AI.},

	abstract = {This teaching case provides a simple yet comprehensive overview of Technical Debt (TD) and its associated terminology to the readers. TD, which has received an increasing amount of attention from information systems (IS) development research and practice, is mainly used to communicate the consequences of sub-optimal design decisions and trade-offs made during software development with non-technical project stakeholders. We reviewed the extant literature and interviewed ﬁve software professionals from a European company to examine this costly phenomenon. As such, we provide a comprehensive understanding of TD, its relevant terminology, and concrete examples that can help information systems and business students better understand the topic. In addition, the teaching case demonstrates antecedents, beneﬁts and challenges, and the responsibilities associated with the accumulation of TD. We argue that, unfortunately, the moral responsibility associated with TD tends to get diffused leading to the invisibility of consequences and de-individuation issues in software teams. To this end, considering the critical role of software-intensive systems in modern societies, we argue that practitioners should look beyond the ﬁnancial or technical costs and beneﬁts of TD and consider the ethical and societal responsibilities associated with its accumulation carefully.},

	abstract = {Objective Our objective was to develop a validated and robust meta-analysis method that can help to address the problems of small sample sizes and complex experimental designs without relying upon data samples being normally distributed.
Method To illustrate the challenges, we used real SE data sets. We built upon previous research and developed a robust meta-analysis method able to deal with challenges typical for SE experiments. We validated our method via simulations comparing Std M D with two robust alternatives: the probability of superiority ( pˆ) and Cliffs’ d.
Results We conﬁrmed that many SE data sets are small and that small experiments run the risk of exhibiting non-normal properties, which can cause problems for analysing families of experiments. For simulations of individual experiments and meta-analyses of families of experiments, pˆ and Cliff’s d consistently outperformed Std M D in terms of negligible small sample bias. They also had better power for log-normal and Laplace samples, although lower power for normal and gamma samples. Tests based on pˆ always had better or equal power than tests based on Cliff’s d, and across all but one simulation condition, pˆ Type 1 error rates were less biased.
Conclusions Using pˆ is a low-risk option for analysing and meta-analysing data from small sample-size SE randomized experiments. Parametric methods are only preferable if you have prior knowledge of the data distribution.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the pressing issue of accurately calculating and predicting the carbon emissions of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, a significant
contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. Despite increasing attention, the methodologies and factors influencing ICT’s carbon footprint remain ambiguous. The study employs a
mixed-methods approach, integrating a systematic literature review, time series analysis, and
regression analysis, to identify significant factors and predict future emissions. Key findings
reveal that electricity consumption is the most critical factor driving ICT emissions, along
with device shipments and energy demand. Predictive models suggest a steady increase
in carbon emissions, reaching 945 MtCO2e in 2030 and 991 MtCO2e by 2035, and highlight discrepancies with previous studies. The study emphasizes the need for standardized
calculating methodologies and constant monitoring to inform policy and industrial actions
successfully. Limitations include reliance on estimated past values and a broad approach
that does not account for the entire life-cycle of ICT devices. Future research should focus
on detailed data collection and ongoing collaboration to address the dynamic nature of technological advancements. This study provides a foundation for more accurate and informed
strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of the ICT sector},

          The widespread adoption of Machine Learning (ML) across various sectors presents unique challenges beyond the scope of conventional software engineering, especially throughout the lifecycle of ML-Enabled Systems (MLES). As ML becomes central to software operations, the substantial computational resources required for their training, testing, retraining, and maintenance underscore the urgent need for sustainable DevOps practices in AI-centric software ecosystems. Despite the critical importance of this subject, there remains a lack of a unified review that addresses these sustainability challenges within the ML lifecycle from a holistic perspective. This study aims to bridge the research gap by conducting a systematic mapping study of current practices and methodologies that promote sustainable MLOps. Additionally, we have mapped these techniques and methodologies across the MLOps pipeline and extracted lessons learned from each phase to enhance our understanding and application of sustainable practices in MLOps. By doing so, this paper seeks to offer insights into strategies that could mitigate the environmental, economic, technical, social, and individual sustainability challenges associated with MLES, thereby contributing to the development of more sustainable ML-Enabled Systems.},

However, quantum computing requires great amounts of energy to run. Therefore, a factor in deciding whether to use quantum computing should be not only the complexity of the problem to be solved, but also the energy required to solve it. This paper presents an empirical study developed with the aim of comparing classical and quantum computing in terms of energy efficiency to determine whether the increased power of quantum computers is offset by their higher energy consumption. To achieve this, a variety of problems with different levels of complexity were tested on both types of computers. Specifically, we used the IBM Quantum computers with a maximum of 5 qubits and an Intel i7, as a classical computer. In addition to this we have also analyzed the evolution of the quantum computers, performing measurements on three time periods. Our empirical study showed that there is a variability of results obtained in the three time periods and that quantum computing is not recommended for low-complexity problems, given its high energy consumption, particularly when compared to traditional computing.},

In this paper, we focus on analysing the differences in energy consumption when running certain algorithms that have been developed using different programming languages. Therefore, we focus on the software quality from the perspective of greenability, in concrete in the aspects related to energy efficiency. For this purpose, this study has conducted an empirical investigation about the most suitable programming languages from an energy efficiency perspective using a hardware-based consumption measurement instrument that obtains real data about energy consumption. The study builds upon a previous study in which energy efficiency of PL were ranked using a software-based approach where the energy consumption is an estimation. As a result, no significant differences are obtained between two approaches, in terms of ranking the PL. However, if it is required to have a more realistic knowledge of consumption, it is necessary to use hardware approaches. Furthermore, the hardware approach provides information about the energy consumption of specific DUT hardware components, such as, HDD, graphics card, and processor, and a ranking for each of component is elaborated. This can provide useful information to make a more informed decision on the choice of a PL, depending on several factors, such as the type of algorithms to be implemented, or the effects on power consumption not only in overall, but also depending on specific DUT hardware components.},

Flexible and sustainable system development models emphasizing energy efficiency can help innovate software development as digital servicing applications shift. This research is motivated by the need to improve energy consumption in early software design and development due to rising technological efficiency and sustainability demands. Although effective in iterative development and stakeholder engagement, traditional Agile methodologies often struggle with long-term sustainability and energy efficiency. Extended Agile, combining Agile, layered architecture, and aspect-oriented frameworks (ALAI), promises to improve system modularity, flexibility, maintainability, and sustainability. This study’s findings are not just theoretical, but also practically relevant, as they explore the energy efficiency of ALAI software development methodologies, using graduate admission information system services (GAISS) as an example. GAISS is a complex system that handles the entire process of graduate admissions, from application submission to final decision. The study quantifies the energy usage of a student-list webpage by analyzing Microsoft IIS server logs from February 2022 to May 2024. Directly applicable findings show that the GAISS based on the ALAI framework reduces energy consumption by 10.7914\% compared to traditional Agile software developments. ALAI used 892.80 kWh versus Agile’s 1000.80 kWh during operations, saving energy. These findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating aspect-oriented frameworks and layering approaches into Agile methodologies, contributing to sustainable software development discourse. The study emphasizes the importance of energy-efficient frameworks such as ALAI to reduce software systems’ environmental impact and promote software development sustainability. The findings of this study, with their practical relevance, assist software developers and organizations in choosing software design and development methods that maximize operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.},

Since GHG enablements usually exceed the footprint, they create the narrative that TNOs contribute to GHG reductions across society. In this paper, we systematically analyze TNO GHG enablement claims and the underlying methodological approaches. We find several methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies, such as different sets of TNO services considered, inconsistent system boundaries, potential double counting of GHG reductions, and a disregard for rebound effects. Most importantly, TNO assessments focus exclusively on those services likely to yield GHG reductions, neglecting possible GHG-increasing services. We conclude that current GHG enablement (factors) do not accurately and comprehensively represent TNOs’ overall GHG impacts and create a flawed picture. To provide a reliable decision basis to stakeholders such as TNOs themselves, customers, investors, and policymakers, we provide eight recommendations on how to substantially improve the methodological basis.},

	title = {“{Do} you have time for a quick call?”: {Exploring} {Remote} and {Hybrid} {Requirements} {Engineering} {Practices} and {Challenges} in {Industry}},
	abstract = {With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing shift away from co-located work arrangements towards working from home, practitioners encountered many collaborative and coordination challenges. While companies are slowly moving back towards in-person arrangements, many employers have permanently adopted fully remote and hybrid work modes. However, the work modes are more blurred, as hybrid work makes coordinating the requirements engineering practices that rely on rich interactions more challenging. Therefore, gaining more understanding of RE challenges and practices from practitioners transitioning to the new modes of work is imperative to identify insights that can be useful for organizations shifting to hybrid and remote work. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to gain insights into remote and hybrid requirements engineering practices and challenges in the industry. Through interviews with 12 industry practitioners and a survey with 49 practitioners, we report on 7 adopted practices and 7 challenges encountered in these work arrangements. We found challenges such as organizing co-located tasks, lack of interpersonal connections, keeping everyone in the loop, and engagement barriers, which fall under coordination, communication and collaboration. To offset such challenges, we provide 20 recommendations based on our findings, such as proactive planning and using newer tools that support comprehensive tracking of important knowledge for requirements documentation. Our findings suggest that practitioners are facing challenges in remote and hybrid work arrangements, which they are mitigating with various strategies. Nonetheless, there remains a need for further research, as not all challenges are equally addressed across different work contexts.},

	title = {Decision-{Making} under {Environmental} {Complexity}: {The} {Need} for {Moving} from {Avoided} {Impacts} of {ICT} {Solutions} to {Systems} {Thinking} {Approaches}},
	abstract = {The indirect impacts of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on the environment (whether positive or negative) have been extensively discussed in academic and industrial literature, particularly within the ICT4S community. However, a lack of consensus exists in academia on how to assess them, especially in the context of decision-making processes. This paper examines whether ‘net impacts accounting’ methods are suitable for decision-making and suggests alternative approaches. We begin by clarifying different scenarios within the context of environmental decisionmaking. Then, we assess their relevance across those different decision scenarios. We emphasize their inadequate response to uncertainties, their focus on solutions rather than problems, and their inability to inspire a range of decisions compatible with an environmental transition. Drawing insights from systems thinking, we finally suggest methods and tools that could be combined to better address the complexity surrounding environmental decision-making. Throughout the paper, we develop the case study of Vinted – a second-hand clothing resale platform – to illustrate our arguments. The contribution advocates for a more systemic approach that embraces complexity by employing mixed methods, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.},

Drawing on insights from other fields, the chapter presents 12 intermediate products of theorizing and what they mean in an SE context. These intermediate products serve different roles: some are theory products to frame research studies, some are theory generators, and others are components of theory. Whereas the SE domain doesn’t have many theories of its own, these intermediate products of theorizing can be found widely. The chapter aims to help readers to recognize these intermediate products, their role, and how they can help in the theorizing process within SE research. To illustrate their utility, the chapter then applies the set of intermediate theorizing products to the software architecture research field. The chapter ends with a suggested structure for a 12-week course on theorizing in SE which can be readily adapted by educators.},

	abstract = {While the methodological rigor of computing research has improved considerably in the past two decades, quantitative software engineering research is hampered by immature measures and inattention to theory. Measurement—the principled assignment of numbers to phenomena—is intrinsically difficult because observation is predicated upon not only theoretical concepts but also the values and perspective of the research. Despite several previous attempts to raise awareness of more sophisticated approaches to measurement and the importance of quantitatively assessing reliability and validity, measurement issues continue to be widely ignored. The reasons are unknown, but differences in typical engineering and computer science graduate training programs (compared to psychology and management, for example) are involved. This chapter therefore reviews key concepts in the science of measurement and applies them to software engineering research. A series of exercises for applying important measurement concepts to the reader’s research are included, and a sample dataset for the reader to try some of the statistical procedures mentioned is provided.},

Digitalization, as a fundamental change in society and the economy, offers great opportunities for sustainable development, but also poses its own threats, as evident in the immense resource consumption and growing surveillance tendencies. To leverage digitalization for sustainability transformation without compromising it, software engineering requires a significant shift in practices and structures.

Systems solutions, such as systems thinking and systems engineering, can help to mitigate such challenges. Systems engineering in particular has to assist in transdisciplinary development and cooperation. Methods, tools, and methodologies in systems engineering can be key enablers to align the present world condition towards sustainable trajectories. To align with the sustainable transition, industrial organizations need to integrate sustainability at their core: the system’s development. Realizing socio-technical systems that are sustainable is not a triviality. Based on industry interviews and a literature study, this article discusses these challenges and presents how systems thinking and systems engineering disciplines may support industries to mitigate the same. To realize sustainable systems this work suggests i) identifying sustainability as a quality of the system; ii) collecting environmentally sustainable (big) data; and iii) establishing a collaborative environment among stakeholders where to discuss challenges related to the system’s lifecycle.},

This development has also put digital technologies in the spotlight both as enablers and inhibitors of sustainability.

Little is known about whether and how an increasing orientation toward sustainability translates into improved business value for software firms. This paper provides a framework for a comprehensive view of sustainability. Based on a survey of 154 Swiss software companies, we find that their beliefs about sustainability, the actions they take by formulating sustainable IS strategies and by implementing them in replicable software development practices result in organizational benefits. Our results show that different sustainability practices can lead to different benefits including cost reduction, improved reputation, and innovation capabilities.},

	abstract = {The theory of sustainability has been analysed and implemented in various sectors to minimise the consumption of limited resources and to consume the fullest potential of existing resources. The triple-bottom concept of sustainability covers all possible interactions within an ecosystem. However, the dynamic nature and inter­ connectivity of sustainability systems, such as the environmental, economic, and social systems, are quite complex to curb sustainability challenges. The modification in one system may create disturbances in other systems. Based on the existing studies on sustainability, this study explored how these systems can be optimised by analysing the relationship between each side of sustainability triangle by 3As, i.e., Adaptability, Affordability and Availability, to determine their impacting macro and micro flows. The reinforcement can be achieved be­ tween social-environment by adaptability, social-economics by affordability and economics-environment by availability. These 3As synergise sustainability systems if inflows and outflows in sustainability systems are optimised. The system dynamic approach was adopted to model and examine all possible 3As’ inflows and outflows comprehensively in urban ecosystems. Micro flows are analysed for the associated macro flows for each factor of triplet. The results suggest that although sustainability systems are complex but not wicked in nature, it is required to focus on macro and micro flows of adaptability, affordability and availability in each system. This study may serve as a source of information for improving and maintaining sustainability in industries, businesses and the policy makers to optimise their existing resources on this comprehensive triplet model.},

It is imperative to steer the aviation industry towards optimizing resources, re ducing costs, improving decision-making and increasing systems’ resilience to unexpected events. In this work, we study the sustainability impact of software architecture principles at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. To this aim, we create a framework that relates architecture principles with sustainability concerns, with the aim of seeking the right balance toward a positive impact on the sustainable development of the organization and its services. We combine techniques like OGSM and Decision Maps to extend the current architecture principles, and elicit Key Performance Indicators from current industrial practice. The resulting framework is the first step towards adopting sustainability in architecting and laying the foundation to monitor the effectiveness of the implemented architecture principles on the target sustainability goals of the organization.},

In this context, understanding the energy consumption of operations on data-structures is crucial when optimizing software to execute under power constricted environments. Existing studies have not focused on the different components of energy consumption that processors expose, rather considering the global consumption. To understand the relationship between CPU and memory energy consumptions with execution time, we instrument a microbenchmark suite to collect such values, and we analyze the results. Our benchmark suite is comprised of 16 implementations of functional sequences, collections and associative collections while measuring detailed energy and time metrics. We further investigate the energy consumption impact of using different compilation optimizations. We have concluded that energy consumption is directly proportional to execution time. Additionally, DRAM and Package energy consumptions are directly proportional, with the DRAM representing between 15 and 31\% of the total energy consumption. Finally, we also conclude that optimizations can have both a positive or a negative impact on energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Making energy consumption data accessible to software developers is an essential step towards energy efficient software engineering. The presence of various different, bespoke and incompatible, methods of instrumentation to obtain energy readings is currently limiting the widespread use of energy data in software development. This paper presents EACOF, a modular Energy-Aware Computing Framework that provides a layer of abstraction between sources of energy data and the applications that exploit them. EACOF replaces platform specific instrumentation through two APIs - one accepts input to the framework while the other provides access to application software. This allows developers to profile their code for energy consumption in an easy and portable manner using simple API calls. We outline the design of our framework and provide details of the API functionality. In a use case, where we investigate the impact of data bit width on the energy consumption of various sorting algorithms, we demonstrate that the data obtained using EACOF provides interesting, sometimes counter-intuitive, insights.

	abstract = {Existing work on the practical impact of software engineering (SE) research examines industrial relevance rather than adoption of study results, hence the question of how results have been practically applied remains open. To answer this and investigate the outcomes of impactful research, we performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 4 335 SE patents citing 1 668 SE papers published between 1975–2017. Moreover, we conducted a survey study on 413 authors of 501 top-cited and awarded publications, achieving 25\% response rate. Overall, researchers have equipped practitioners with various tools, processes, and methods, and improved many existing products. SE practice seems to value knowledge-seeking research and is impacted by diverse cross-disciplinary SE areas. Practitioner-oriented publication venues appear more impactful than researcher–, while industry-related tracks in conferences could enhance their impact. Some research works did not reach a wide footprint due to limited funding resources or unfavorable cost-beneﬁt tradeoff of the proposed solutions. The need for higher funding in SE research could be corroborated through a dedicated empirical study. In general, the assessment of impact is subject to its deﬁnition. Therefore, academia and industry could jointly agree on a formal description to set a common ground for subsequent research on the topic.},

These opportunities span a wide range of software characteristics, such as mobile applications and concurrent programming. Mobile applications is the topic with the greatest number of opportunities (6 out of 11).

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Self-efficacy is a concept researched in various areas of knowledge that impacts various factors such as performance, satisfaction, and motivation. In Software Engineering, it has mainly been studied in the academic context, presenting results similar to other areas of knowledge. However, it is also important to understand its impact in the industrial context. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, this study aims to understand the impact on the software development context with a focus on understanding the behavioral signs of self-efficacy in software engineers and how self-efficacy can impact the work-day of software engineers. METHOD: A qualitative research was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires with 31 interviewees from a software development company located in Brazil. The interviewees participated in a Bootcamp and were later assigned to software development teams. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: In the perception of the interviewees, 21 signs were found that are related to people with high and low self-efficacy. These signs were divided into two dimensions: social and cognitive. Also, 18 situations were found that can lead to an increase or decrease of self-efficacy of software engineers. Finally, 12 factors were mentioned that can impact software development teams. CONCLUSION: This work evidences a set of behavioral signs that can help team leaders to better perceive the self-efficacy of their members. It also presents a set of situations that both leaders and individuals can use to improve their self-efficacy in the development context, and finally, factors that can be impacted by self-efficacy in the software development context are also presented. Finally, this work emphasizes the importance of understanding self-efficacy in the industrial context.},

In this context, accountability becomes critical, since it comprises responsible actions as well as their results considering regulations and sanctions. To cope with such a requirement, systems thinking (ST) can be used for conducting analysis, synthesis, and inquiry into the system's parts and the whole. We argue that applying ST lens to IS management may improve accountability and then decision-making. Therefore, we propose the accountability suggestion map (ASM) as an approach to cover users' feedbacks aiming to promote accountability in IS management. This paper (1) presents ASM as a structure for representing systemic behaviors over time and then accountability suggestions, and (2) reports the application of ASM in an organizational scenario in the education domain. It was chosen since it encompasses management challenges, e.g., different IS must interoperate, each one with its own objective and within organizational units. As such, we analyzed two diagrams addressing daily issues regarding the absence of teachers and school evasion rates, respectively. We claim that ASM contributes to describe the environment and provide a set of suggestions to mitigate daily issues.},

	abstract = {The heavy reliance on information and communication technology (ICT) has prompted the importance of cyber security more than ever in history. Although there are various studies that explored the importance of cyber­ security solutions, the impact of production and usage of these solutions on the natural environment and their economic impact has been rarely researched. The objective of this research is to investigate the environmental and economic impact of cybersecurity solutions. An extensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been performed on three cybersecurity solutions to assess and compare their environmental impact. Based on global warming potential, the embodied carbon footprint was determined. Carbon footprint and operational costs were used to calculate Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis and these data were then used to compare the eco-efficiency of the three cybersecurity solutions. This research compares three cybersecurity solutions: Next Generation DataGuard (NGD), Current State of Art Solution (CSAS), and a Generic Cybersecurity Solution (GCS), to identify an economically viable and environmentally friendly cybersecurity solution. The result of the analysis indicated that NGD was approximately 58\% and 88\% more energy-efficient than CSAS and GCS, respectively. Also, the LCC of NGD was approximately 6\%- 12\% lower than CSAS and 22\%- 40\% lower than GCS in selected provinces in Canada. The eco-efficiency of CSAS was approximately 60\% less than NGD. Next Generation DataGuard is found to be a successful solution in this research among the three solutions. This study will be useful to researchers, cybersecurity industries, and policymakers to develop informed decisions on cybersecurity solutions.},

	volume = {35},
	abstract = {Many usability professionals struggling with limited budgets and recognition use only 5 participants for us-ability testing, rather than larger samples typically re-quired for empirical research. Large numbers of test ses-sions call for resources not readily available to usability practitioners, who are frequently solo venturers within a development group or company. Despite its attractive-ness for usability professionals' efforts to gain accep-tance for themselves and their practices, other practi-tioners wondered if what this author has termed the 5-user assumption was appropriate and representative of best practices for the field. Articles with titles such as Why Five Users Aren't Enough (Woolrych \& Cockton, 2001) and Eight is Not Enough (Perfetti \& Landesman, 2002) critique the assumption, highlight issues of relia-bility with small user sets, and express concern over the impact of usability problems that may be missed when only 5 users are tested. Early studies supporting the assumption argued that just 5 participants could reveal about 80\% of all usabil-ity problems that exist in a product (Nielsen, 1993; Virzi, 1992). This figure indicates a probability of the percent-age of problems missed; there is, currently, no way to de-termine with reasonable certainty that any set of f ive tests matched those percentages, or which particular problems were revealed or missed (Woolrych \& Cock-ton, 2001). Furthermore, if, for example, only novice users were tested, a large number of usability problems may have been revealed, but the test would not show which are the most severe and deserve the highest prior-ity fixes. Expert results may highlight severe or unusual problems but miss problems that are fatal for novice users. Finally, the abstract argument in favor of the as-sumption depends on the independence of the problems encountered—that is, that encountering one of them will not increase or decrease the likelihood of encountering any other problem. This author envisioned a way to address these issues: Conduct usability tests in which data are collected from larger samples of multilevel users. If the resulting data could then be presented in an accessible manner for us-ability professionals who are not well versed in the com-plexities of statistics, the practitioners could come to rec-ognize the risks of the 5-user assumption and the benefits of additional users. Background The 5-user assumption arose from two sources: (1) secondary analyses of other testers' data by Nielsen (1993) and (2) " law-of-diminishing-returns " arguments made by Virzi (1992). Both Nielsen (1993) and Virzi sought to demonstrate that statistical rigor can be relaxed considerably in real-world usability testing. However, in applying the assumption, usability practitioners have ex-perienced limitations. For example, in one study (Spool \& Schroeder, 2001) the first 5 users revealed only 35\% of the usability problems. Furthermore, both the 13th and 15th users tested revealed at least one new severe prob-lem that would have been missed if the study team had stopped after the first five test sessions. Another study team tested 18 users; each new user, including those in test sessions 6–18, found " more than five new obstacles " (Perfetti \& Landesman, 2002). Again, the problems in those later sessions would have been missed had the study team stopped after the first five user-test sessions. The usability problems found by these teams and others, beyond the 5-user barrier, indicate the need to move us-ability practices toward increasing maturity to account for usability problems missed by the first 5 users. Build-ing on the foundational work of Nielsen (1993) and Virzi, it is appropriate to revisit the calculations and data on which the assumption was based. Virzi's (1992) essential finding was that 5 users would uncover approximately 80\% of the usability problems in a product. In cases of the most severe errors, he indicated},

The present study describes the effect of UI content customization on learnability and perceived workload. Participants were asked to create 20 different products using four different web prototypes that varied in content density and customization capability. Mean time on task over 20 trials was fit using a power function and perceived workload was collected using NASA Task Load Index. The results obtained indicate that content customization allows users to reach peak performance faster and reduce task learning. Also, content customization reduces perceived mental demand and frustration as content density increases. Finally, participants performed faster and with higher satisfaction under the customization conditions.},

	abstract = {Context: Software producing organizations have the ability to address the energy impact of their software products through their source code and software architecture. In spite of that, the focus often remains on hardware aspects, which limits the contribution of software towards energy efficient ICT solutions. Objective: No methods exist to provide software architects information about the energy consumption of the different components in their software product. The objective of this paper is to bring software producing organizations in control of this qualitative aspect of their software. Method: To achieve the objective, we developed the StEP Method to systematically investigate the effects of software units through the use of software stubs in relation to energy concerns. To evaluate the proposed method, an experiment involving three different versions of a commercial software product has been conducted. In the experiment, two versions of a software product were stubbed according to stakeholder concerns and stressed according to a test case, whilst energy consumption measurements were performed. The method provided guidance for the experiment and all activities were documented for future purposes. Results: Comparing energy consumption differences across versions unraveled the energy consumption related to the products’ core functionality. Using the energy profile, stakeholders could identify the major energy consuming elements and prioritize software engineering efforts to maximize impact. Conclusions: We introduce the StEP Method and demonstrate its applicability in an industrial setting. The method identified energy hotspots and thereby improved the control stakeholders have over the sustainability of a software product. Despite promising results, several concerns are identified that require further attention to improve the method. For instance, we recommend the investigation of software operation data to determine, and possibly automatically create, stubs.},

The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications.},

We were also interested in learning if there could be some signs that would help us in marketing to get more women into tech. We approached the topic via an online survey (N = 78) sent to the university students of software engineering in Finland. Our results show that, on average, women apply later to software engineering studies than men, with statistically significant differences between genders. Additionally, we found that marketing actions have different impacts based on gender: personal guidance in live events or platforms is most influential for women, whereas teachers and social media have a more significant impact on men. The results also indicate two main paths into the field: the traditional linear educational pathway and the adult career change pathway, each significantly varying by gender.},

	title = {Statistically {Rigorous} {Java} {Performance} {Evaluation} {General}},
	abstract = {Java performance is far from being trivial to benchmark because it is affected by various factors such as the Java application, its input, the virtual machine, the garbage collector, the heap size, etc. In addition, non-determinism at run-time causes the execution time of a Java program to differ from run to run. There are a number of sources of non-determinism such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and optimization in the virtual machine (VM) driven by timer-based method sampling, thread scheduling, garbage collection, and various system effects. There exist a wide variety of Java performance evaluation methodologies used by researchers and benchmarkers. These methodologies differ from each other in a number of ways. Some report average performance over a number of runs of the same experiment; others report the best or second best performance ob-served; yet others report the worst. Some iterate the benchmark multiple times within a single VM invocation; others consider mul-tiple VM invocations and iterate a single benchmark execution; yet others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate the benchmark multiple times. This paper shows that prevalent methodologies can be mis-leading, and can even lead to incorrect conclusions. The reason is that the data analysis is not statistically rigorous. In this pa-per, we present a survey of existing Java performance evaluation methodologies and discuss the importance of statistically rigorous data analysis for dealing with non-determinism. We advocate ap-proaches to quantify startup as well as steady-state performance, and, in addition, we provide the JavaStats software to automatically obtain performance numbers in a rigorous manner. Although this paper focuses on Java performance evaluation, many of the issues addressed in this paper also apply to other programming languages and systems that build on a managed runtime system.},

	abstract = {Run-time management of modern Web-based services requires the integration of several algorithms and mechanisms for job dispatching , load sharing, admission control, overload detection. All these algorithms should take decisions on the basis of present and/or future load conditions of the system resources. In particular, we address the issue of predicting future resource loads under real-time constraints in the context of Internet-based systems. In this situation , it is extremely difficult to deduce a representative view of a system resource from collected raw measures that show very large variability even at different time scales. For this reason, we propose a two-step approach that first aims to get a representative view of the load trend from measured raw data, and then applies a load prediction algorithm to load trends. This approach is suitable to support different decision systems even for highly variable contexts and is characterized by a computational complexity that is compatible to run-time decisions. The proposed models are applied to a multi-tier Web-based system, but the results can be extended to other Internet-based contexts where the systems are characterized by similar workloads and resource behaviors.},

A review of literature reveals that waterfall model uses linear approach and is only suitable for sequential or procedural design. In waterfall, errors can only be detected at the end of the whole process and it may be difficult going back to repeat the entire process because the processes are sequential. Also, software based on waterfall approach is difficult to maintain and upgrade due to lack of integration between software components. On the other hand, the Object Oriented approach enables software systems to be developed as integration of software objects that work together to make a holistic and functional system. The software objects are independent of each other, allowing easy upgrading and maintenance of software codes. The paper also highlighted the merits and demerits of each of the approaches.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientiﬁc ﬁeld. In this framework, a research ﬁnding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a ﬁeld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater ﬂexibility in designs, deﬁnitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater ﬁnancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in chase of statistical signiﬁcance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientiﬁc ﬁelds, claimed research ﬁndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

	abstract = {Companies are increasingly adopting cloud-based solutions to provide their employees with tools for flexible work. The environmental consequences of this trend, although largely under-researched, are likely to be negative. In fact, by enabling integrated and easy-to-use features (document collaboration, backups, online meetings, etc.), using the cloud typically leads to a growth in data traffic and outsourced computation. At the same time, the 2022 IPCC report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) calls for sufficiency measures to reach net-zero emissions, i.e. actions on the demand side to avoid unnecessary consumption of resources. However, how much and which cloud usage is “sufficient” for flexible work? This study explores the answer to this question by using qualitative research methods. We carried out three focus groups within two companies, investigating the daily use of digital technologies in flexible work. A thematic analysis using open coding was performed on the outcome. Our findings include (i) a list of main digital work activities and differences according to work settings, (ii) the perceptions of what makes certain digital activities or their cloud feature necessary, and (iii) a list of tactics towards sufficiency and the perceived benefits and challenges associated to them. In our increasingly connected work environments, there are plenty of opportunities to decrease our digital footprint by recentering on the essentials, and simultaneously bring co-benefits like focus, and better quality of life.},

	abstract = {The software development industry is gradually fostering diversity within its workforce. Recognizing that diverse teams often produce superior results, companies are increasingly committing to creating more inclusive environments. Diversity encompasses many dimensions such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, nationality, and neurodiversity. While gender has been the most extensively addressed dimension in software engineering research, the focus on neurodiversity has been primarily directed towards users, rather than developers. Developers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) face unique challenges due to difficulties with executive functions, the cognitive processes essential for behavioral control. These processes include skills such as inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, working memory, and planning, all of which are vital for effective teamwork and job performance. In this pilot study, we attempt to fill the existing knowledge gap about neurodiverse software developers. Using a socio-technical grounded theory approach, we investigate the challenges these developers face and explore how adjustments to agile team practices could enhance their comfort. The emergent results from this study present promising insights and implications for research about neurodiverse software developers, contributing to a more inclusive and productive workplace environment.},

We perform a critical analysis of current design practice with regard to interactive services, which we identify as the cornucopian paradigm. We show how user-centered design principles induce environmental impacts in different ways, and combine with technical and business drivers to drive growth of the infrastructure through a reinforcing feedback cycle. We then create a design rubric, substantially extending that of Blevis [6], to cover impacts of the digital infrastructure. In doing so, we engage in design criticism, identifying examples (both actual and potential) of good and bad practice. We then extend this rubric beyond an ecoefficiency paradigm to consider deeper and more radical perspectives on sustainability, and finish with future directions for exploration.},

	abstract = {The progress of some AI paradigms such as deep learning is said to be linked to an exponential growth in the number of parameters. There are many studies corroborating these trends, but does this translate into an exponential increase in energy consumption? In order to answer this question we focus on inference costs rather than training costs, as the former account for most of the computing effort, solely because of the multiplicative factors. Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive perspective, we analyse relevant models in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a much softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated. The only caveat is, yet again, the multiplicative factor, as future AI increases penetration and becomes more pervasive.},

In light of the ecological crises and the tremendous impact of digital systems on reshaping economic and social arrangements - often with negative side-effects - we need a sustainability transformation of the digital trans­ formation. However, this is a complex and long-term task. In this article we combine an analysis of accountability arrangements in software engineering and a model of sustainability transformations to trace how certain dy­ namics are starting to make software engineering accountable for sustainability in the technological, cultural, economic and governance domains. The article discusses existing approaches for sustainable software engi­ neering and software engineering for sustainability, traces emerging discourses that connect digitalization and sustainability, highlights new digital business models that may support sustainability and shows governance efforts to highlight “green and digital” policy problems. Yet, we argue that these are so far niche dynamics and that a sustainability transformation requires a collective and long-lasting effort to engender systemic changes. The goal should be to create varied accountability arrangements for sustainability in software engineering which is embedded in complex ways in society and economy.},

More importantly, these evaluation criteria and practices are not fixed and needs further improvement from time to time due to the shifts in the environment, business needs and current trends. As a result, there is a need for a mechanism that can systematically organise those evaluation criteria and practices to ensure the sustainability of the assessment and certification process. Furthermore, based on the literature, currently there is a lack in the quality of test cases for Agile software development process. The testing process is critical for demonstrating the quality of a software product, however it is only partially addressed in the existing software process quality assessment and certification models. The Agile testing practices need to be improved in the existing software process quality assessment and certification reference standard so that it can tolerate with changes. Majority of the existing software process quality assessment and certification models have not addressed sustainable software architecture. Consequently, this research is working towards developing a sustainable software architecture for the software process quality assessment and certification. As a beginning, this paper illustrates the conceptual model which will be used as base to develop a sustainable architecture for software process quality assessment and certification. The contributions of this study straddle research perspectives of Software Process Assessment and Certification with the existence of the sustainable software architecture. From a practical perspective, this study will provide software practitioners with a more systematic and effective approach for assessment and certification.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of digital solutions integrating cloud-based software services necessitates sustainability awareness of such solutions. The integration of sustainability needs evaluation early in the software development life-cycle; preferably at the software architecture level. Although extensive literature is available for software architecture evaluation, not so much is observed for sustainability awareness, in general, and specifically for cloud-based software service architectures. In this study, we aim to create a blueprint of a software architecture evaluation method that has the potential to guide the sustainability-aware software architecture evaluation of cloud-based software services. We use the knowledge extracted from existing software architecture evaluation methods from our previous work and identify the steps to develop a generic blueprint for software architecture evaluation. Our blueprint of software architecture evaluation methods consists of 11 general steps divided into 3 phases. We discuss the challenges of software architecture evaluation and provide recommendations; in general and in the context of sustainability. We further present additional sub-steps that supplement the software architecture evaluation blueprint with a sustainability-focused trade-off analysis, impact analysis and prioritization. The software architecture evaluation blueprint can be used and customized for the evaluation of cloud-based software service architectures based on cloud-based software service-specific evaluation criteria (quality attributes/metrics) for sustainability awareness. Future work involves identifying sustainability metrics and evaluating the blueprint in an industrial setting for cloud-based software services.},

We present a data quality (DQ) model and a methodology specific to software engineering experiments, which provides a systematic approach in order to analyze and improve data quality in this domain. Method. Our proposal considers a multifaceted view of data quality suitable for this context, which enables the discovery of DQ problems that are not generally addressed. We successfully applied the model (DQMoS) and methodology (DQMeS) in four controlled experiments, detecting different quality problems that could impact the experimental results. We present, through a running example, how we applied the DQMoS and DQMeS to one of the four experimental data. Results. We found that between 55\% and 75\% of the DQ metrics applied showed the presence of a DQ problem in all four experiments. In all cases, the experimental results had already been obtained before the DQMeS application. This means that the DQ problems we found, were not discovered by the experimenters during or before making their experiment’s analysis. Results yield data quality problems that experimenters did not detect on their own analysis, and that affect the experimental response variables . Our proposal shows a formalized framework that measures and improves the quality of software engineering experimental data. The results of a survey distributed to the experiments’ responsibles show that they value the improvements introduced by the model and methodology, and that they intend to apply them again in future experiences. Conclusions. DQMoS and DQMeS are useful to increase the confidence in the quality of data used in software engineering experiments, and improve the trust in experimental results.},

However, despite its importance, recently published studies have shown that Software Engineers have not reached a common and clear understanding of Sustainable Software Development (SSD). Consequently, it might be challenging to understand the value of the principles behind sustainability and how Software Engineers should apply them in practice. Therefore, the first step is to promote a field characterization to mitigate such effects to bridge such a gap. This paper reports on qualitative data analysis to leverage the sustainability principles through the support of the Grounded Theory method. We conducted this study using unstructured data retrieved from a systematic mapping study on sustainable software engineering and a survey applied in the software industry. To achieve the principles, we considered five critical dimensions: economic, social, individual, environmental, and technical. The key results are: (i) technical, environmental, and social concerns are present in all software development life-cycle (SDLC) phases; (ii) software engineers should consider sustainability requirements in the early SDLC phases; (iii) there is a need for stakeholder engagement focused on sustainability; (iv) software quality requirements support the development of sustainable software; and (v) sustainable concerns could generate trade-offs in the project. The yielded results might trigger further discussions around the SSD’s underlying principles and concepts and serve as a basis for the research community to identify models, techniques, and tools to support SSD.},

This paper describes two experimental activities where the objective is to explore the possibility of obtaining quantitative data sets necessary for visualization, one based on competencies and the other based on knowledge areas. Both activities were based on surveys. The results from the first activity showed that a consensus interpretation could be obtained for the knowledge, skills, and dispositions implied by the competency descriptions, although not as strongly for dispositions. The second activity resulted in a table of knowledge areas with minimum and maximum weights for six computing subdisciplines. Finally, this paper also shows two examples of how users can explore the various curricular guidelines through visualization.},

More than twenty performance metrics such as CPU and memory usage sampled twice per minute for a month on nineteen test systems driving nightly testing of cyber-physical systems has been anonymized and released. The industrial motivation is to spur work on anomaly detection in seasonal data such that one may increase trust in nightly testing. One could ask: If the test system is in an abnormal state – can we trust the test results? How could one automate the detection of abnormal states? The data set has previously been used by students and in hackathons. By releasing it we hope to simplify experiments on anomaly detection based on rules, thresholds, statistics, machine learning or artificial intelligence, perhaps while incorporating seasonality. We also hope that the data set could lead to findings in sustainable software engineering.},

In this paper, I bring Selwyn's call for ecocritical awareness in the field of educational technology into conversation with emerging scholarly discussions in the fields of ecojustice ethics, ecojustice education, and information and communications technology sustainability. In so doing, I expand the existing conversation about the environmental impact of educational technology consumption to argue that the process of cultivating an ecocritical awareness in the field of educational technology requires refining  the discipline's focus to include the full lifespan of educational technology devices and the global inequities that feature during the production and disposal of these devices.},

Decision-making techniques help with both these problems. However, the techniques should be thought of as aids to decision-making and not the substitutes for it. Numerous decision-making techniques have been proposed as effective methods of ranking software products for selection for use as components in large-scale systems. Many of these techniques have been developed and successfully applied in other arenas and have been either used directly or adapted to be applied to COTS product evaluation and selection. This paper will show that many of these techniques are not valid when applied in this manner. We will describe an alternate requirements-driven technique that could be more effective.},

However, no single Agile method can fit every organization, which leads to a lack of adoption guidelines. It triggers this investigation by proposing an Agile development method model based on the Essence of software engineering framework and incorporating the common ground of popular methods such as Scrum, Kanban, Extreme programming, SAFe, Less, Nexus, Spotify Agile, Scrum of Scrums, and Disciplined Agile. The Essence of software engineering framework provides an approach for organizations to develop software development methods based on common ground or shared understanding among methods. We enhance this approach for Agile methods, resulting in a model to support organizations in developing their Agile methods and practices. Moreover, Design Science Research (DSR) was employed as a methodology to construct the artifact, demonstration, and evaluation. We demonstrated the model in an Agile product development at a national-wide bank in Indonesia. This investigation enhances Agile methods in SWEBOK's Software Engineering Models and Methods knowledge area, benefiting academics and practitioners. Practitioners can use the model as a reference to implement their Agile projects.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, energy efficiency research has focused on reducing energy consumption at the hardware level and, more recently, in the design and coding phases of the software development life cycle. However, software testing’s impact on energy consumption did not receive attention from the research community. Specifically, how test code design quality and test smell (e.g., sub-optimal design and bad practices in test code) impact energy consumption has not been investigated yet. This study examined 12 Apache projects to analyze the association between test smell and its effects on energy consumption in software testing. We conducted a mixed-method empirical analysis from two dimensions; software (data mining in Apache projects) and developers’ views (a survey of 62 software practitioners). Our findings show that: 1) test smell is associated with energy consumption in software testing. Specifically smelly part of a test case consumes 10.92\% more energy compared to the non-smelly part. 2) certain test smells are more energy-hungry than others, 3) refactored test cases tend to consume less energy than their smelly counterparts, and 4) most developers lack knowledge about test smells’ impact on energy consumption. We conclude the paper with several observations that can direct future research and developments.},

	abstract = {Objectives: In this work, we aim at understanding the state of the art of energy efficient tactics, in terms of activities in the field, tactic properties, tactic evaluation rigor, and potential for industrial adoption.
Method: We leverage a systematic literature review based on a search query and two rounds of bi-directional snowballing. We identify 142 primary studies, reporting on 163 tactics, which we extract and analyze via a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
Results: The research interest in the topic peaked in 2015 and then steadily declined. Tactics on source code static optimizations and application level dynamic monitoring are the most frequently studied. Industry involvement is limited. This potentially creates a vicious cycle in which practitioners cannot apply tactics due to low industrial relevance, and academic researchers struggle to increase the industrial relevance of their findings.
Conclusions: Despite the energy consumed by software is a growing concern, the future of energy efficiency tactics research does not look bright. From our results emerges a call for action, the need for academic researchers and industrial practitioners to join forces for creating real impact.},

The purpose of this article is to clearly describe the differences in indications between scoping reviews and systematic reviews and to provide guidance for when a scoping review is (and is not) appropriate.
Results: Researchers may conduct scoping reviews instead of systematic reviews where the purpose of the review is to identify knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify concepts or to investigate research conduct. While useful in their own right, scoping reviews may also be helpful precursors to systematic reviews and can be used to confirm the relevance of inclusion criteria and potential questions.
Conclusions: Scoping reviews are a useful tool in the ever increasing arsenal of evidence synthesis approaches. Although conducted for different purposes compared to systematic reviews, scoping reviews still require rigorous and transparent methods in their conduct to ensure that the results are trustworthy. Our hope is that with clear guidance available regarding whether to conduct a scoping review or a systematic review, there will be less scoping reviews being performed for inappropriate indications better served by a systematic review, and vice-versa.},

Continuous research on the topic of environmentally sustainable software engineering practices is essential to mitigate the environmental impact of software products and advance software processes that promote sustainability. Despite recognizing the issue, many software industry practitioners struggle to identify sustainability requirements for software products during software development. Many are unaware of any applied process models or other software engineering artifacts to support sustainability in software engineering practices. This working paper intends to map practitioner-focused outcomes and academic research in sustainable software engineering. By adopting a practitioner's perspective, we categorize 11 types of software engineering artifacts. These artifacts represent tangible research outcomes for software practitioners and help with systematically analyzing academic publications on sustainable software engineering between 2001-2022. The analysis is based on a three-stage literature screening process, out of which three intermediate datasets are analyzed. The study provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns of research output, emphasizing the significance of artifacts and acknowledging their contribution to the field. The aim is to promote sustainable software engineering by considering and mapping the perspectives of both academics and practitioners. Furthermore, it opens up opportunities for future research and development.},

	abstract = {Recently, attention has been drawn to the sustainability of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in terms of environmental costs. However, sustainability is not tantamount to the reduction of environmental costs. By shifting the focus to intergenerational justice as one of the constitutive normative pillars of sustainability, the paper identiﬁes a reductionist view on the sustainability of AI and constructively contributes a conceptual extension. It further develops a framework that establishes normative issues of intergenerational justice raised by the uses of AI. The framework reveals how using AI for decision support to policies with long-term impacts can negatively affect future persons. In particular, the analysis demonstrates that uses of AI for decision support to policies of environmental protection or climate mitigation include assumptions about social discounting and future persons’ preferences. These assumptions are highly controversial and have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the weight assigned to the potentially detrimental impacts of a policy on future persons. Furthermore, these underlying assumptions are seldom transparent within AI. Subsequently, the analysis provides a list of assessment questions that constitutes a guideline for the revision of AI techniques in this regard. In so doing, insights about how AI can be made more sustainable become apparent.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11129},
	abstract = {Background: Sustainable software engineering (SSE) means creating software in a way that meets present needs without undermining our collective capacity to meet our future needs. It is typically conceptualized as several intersecting dimensions or “pillars”—environmental, social, economic, technical and individual. However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require reﬁnement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and improve the existing models identiﬁed. Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from ﬁve article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratiﬁed (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of speciﬁc sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratiﬁed, and assessed accordingly.},

Sustainable Software Engineering, as a recent research area, incorporates sustainability principles and dimensions in the software development process. On the other hand, the Design Science Research methodology has become a well-received research paradigm in Information Systems in general and in Software Engineering in particular. The paper presents a Sustainable Software Engineering approach integrated into the Design Science Research methodology. The concepts of sustainability in software development, namely the principles of the Karlskrona Manifesto, the principles of Green Software Engineering and the Sustainable Development Goals are integrated into the approach. Preliminary results from applying the approach indicate that the iterative process of the Design Science Research methodology allows for the integration of multidisciplinary sustainability artefacts during the software process.},

	abstract = {Sustainability is an increasingly-studied topic in software engineering in general, and in software architecture in particular. There are already a number of secondary studies addressing sustainability in software engineering, but no such study focusing explicitly on software architecture. This work aims to ﬁll this gap by conducting a systematic mapping study on the intersection between sustainability and software architecture research with the intention of (i) reﬂecting on the current state of the art, and (ii) identifying the needs for further research. Our results show that, overall, existing works have focused disproportionately on speciﬁc aspects of sustainability, and in particular on the most technical and “inward facing” ones. This comes at the expense of the holistic perspective required to address a multi-faceted concern such as sustainability. Furthermore, more reﬂection-oriented research works, and better coverage of the activities in the architecting life cycle are required to further the maturity of the area. Based on our ﬁndings we then propose a research agenda for sustainability-aware software architecture.},

	abstract = {Research shows that the global society as organized today, with our current technological and economic system, is impossible to sustain. We are living in the Anthropocene, an era in which human activities in highly industrialized countries are responsible for overshooting several planetary boundaries, with poorer communities contributing least to the problems but being impacted the most. At the same time, technical and economic gains fail to provide society at large with equal opportunities and improved quality of life. This paper describes approaches taken in computing education to address the issue of sustainability. It presents results of a systematic review of literature on sustainability in computing education. From a set of 572 publications extracted from six large digital libraries plus snowballing, we distilled and analyzed the 90 relevant primary studies. Using an inductive and deductive thematic analysis, we study 1) conceptions of sustainability, computing, and education, 2) implementations of sustainability in computing education, and 3) research on sustainability in computing education. We present a framework capturing learning objectives and outcomes as well as pedagogical methods for sustainability in computing education. These results can be mapped to existing standards and curricula in future work. We find that only a few of the articles engage with the challenges as calling for drastic systemic change, along with radically new understandings of computing and education. We suggest that future research should connect to the substantial body of critical theory such as feminist theory of science and technology. Existing research on sustainability in computing education may be considered as rather immature as the majority of articles are experience reports with limited empirical research.},

The objective of this paper was to explore how sustainability concepts have been integrated in Information Systems (IS) curricula, to determine the state of knowledge in this area and provide guidance for future research. Using Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage scoping review process, the current landscape of sustainability in IS classrooms is mapped and key themes and factors which were found to influence sustainability education in IS are identified. Eight databases were searched for relevant papers published on this topic. Fifteen articles were selected and deemed high quality for a thematic analysis. As a result, nine themes emerged from the thematic analysis, and key research gaps and directions for future research are presented. The findings show that there is currently no unified approach to sustainability education in IS. This paper presents the themes in a novel conceptual research framework which can guide the incorporation of sustainability concepts in IS education. In addition, the framework can be used as the basis for future research in this area.},

            Students of two computer science--related study programmes (CS/IT) reflected on their engagement in their field of study at different times during the first three study years. Drawing on social identity theory, the focus has been to analyse and describe different ways in which the students experience participation in CS/IT, i.e., doing, thinking, and feeling, in relation to CS/IT, negotiated among different people. Insights into participation in CS/IT were used to discuss what it entails to fit in and become a computing professional.
            Phenomenographic analysis yields an outcome space that describes increasingly broad ways in which first-, second-, and third-year students experience participation in CS/IT. Two further outcome spaces provide nuanced insights into experiences that are of increasing relevance as the students advance in their studies, participation as problem solving, and problem solving for others.
            Participation as problem solving appears to be central in this learning environment and the students integrate such experiences into their histories of engagement in CS/IT. In study year 3, the students also reason about participation as problem solving for others that they encounter in the human computer interaction course. However, at that time several students perform a technical problem solver identity and reject such broader ways of participating in CS/IT.},

	abstract = {Context: Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demands a shift by industry, governments, society, and individuals to reach adequate levels of awareness and actions to address sustainability challenges. Software systems will play an important role in moving towards these targets. Sustainability skills are necessary to support the development of software systems and to provide sustainable IT-supported services for citizens. Gap: While there is a growing number of academic bodies, including sustainability education in engineering and computer science curricula, there is not yet comprehensive research on the competencies and skills required by IT professionals to develop such systems. Research goal: This study aims to identify the industrial sustainability needs for education and training from software engineers’ perspective. For this we answer the following questions: (1) what are the interests of organisations with an IT division with respect to sustainability? (2) what do organisations want to achieve with respect to sustainability, and how? and (3) what are the sustainability-related competencies and skills that organisations need to achieve their sustainability goals? Methodology: We conducted a qualitative study with interviews and focus groups with experts from twenty-eight organisations with an IT division from nine countries to understand their interests, goals and achievements related to sustainability, and the skills and competencies needed to achieve their goals. Results: Our ﬁndings show that organisations are interested in sustainability, both idealistically and increasingly for core business reasons. They seek to improve the sustainability of processes and products but encounter difﬁculties, like the trade-off between short-term ﬁnancial proﬁtability and long-term sustainability goals or an unclear understanding of sustainability concepts. To ﬁll these gaps, they have promoted in-house training courses, collaborated with universities, and sent employees to external training. The acquired competencies should support translating environmental and social beneﬁts into economic ones and make sustainability an integral part of software development. We conclude that educational programs should include knowledge and skills on core sustainability concepts, system thinking, soft skills, technical sustainability, building the business case for sustainability, sustainability impact and measurements, values and ethics, standards and legal aspects, and advocacy and lobbying.},

For that reason, we investigate the current state of debugging in a comprehensive study. First, we review the available literature and learn about current approaches and study results. Second, we observe several professional developers while debugging and interview them about their experiences. Third, we create a questionnaire that serves as the basis for a larger online debugging survey.

We suggest that story-thinking and computational-thinking may be understood as two ways of attending to the world, and that each both contributes and neglects the world, though in different ways and for different ends. We formulate two fundamental problems, i.e., the problem of “neglectful representations” and the problem of oppositional ways of thinking. We brieﬂy suggest two ways in which these problems might be tackled and identify candidate hypotheses about the current state of the world, one assertion about a possible future state, and several research questions for future research.},

Data were gathered and analyzed using grounded theory from workshop with different software development practitioners to seek their understanding on what sustainability means in their software systems. The results show economic and technical sustainability dimensions are the most important to software development practitioners for software sustainability. While the social sustainability dimension was not considered for software sustainability. The ﬁndings from this study indicates contrast in academia where all sustainability dimensions are treated as an important element to achieve software sustainability.

Sustainable digital services and product delivery cannot be achieved without embracing sustainable software design practices. Despite the current research progress on software sustainability, most software development practitioners in developing countries are unclear about what constitutes software sustainability and often lack the proper understanding of how to implement it in their specific industry domain. Research efforts from software engineering focused on promoting software sustainability awareness in developed countries, and fewer efforts have been channeled to studying the same awareness in developing countries. This has affected the level of awareness about sustainable software design practices in most developing countries. This research investigates the awareness of software sustainability in the Nigerian pension industry and its challenges among practitioners. The software development practitioners were engaged and interviewed. We offered ways to mitigate the identified challenges and promote the awareness of software sustainability in the pension industry. Our findings further show that, with the right sustainability knowledge, the software practitioners in the pension industry have the potential to support their organization's sustainable culture and improve the efficiency of product design and service delivery.},

These courses allow students to create a software solution and demonstrate the knowledge they accumulated in their degrees. However, a typical capstone project team is small containing no more than 5 students and function independently from other teams. To better reﬂect real-world software development and meet industry demands, we introduce in this paper our novel capstone course. Each student was assigned to a large-scale, multi-team (i.e., company) of up to 20 students to collaboratively build software. Students placed in a company gained ﬁrst-hand experiences with respect to multi-team coordination, integration, communication, agile, and teamwork to build a microservices based project. Furthermore, each company was required to implement plug-and-play so that their services would be compatible with another company, thereby sharing common APIs. Through developing the product in autonomous sub-teams, the students enhanced not only their technical abilities but also their soft skills such as communication and coordination. More importantly, experiencing the challenges that arose from the multi-team project trained students to realize the pitfalls and advantages of organizational culture. Among many lessons learned from this course experience, students learned the critical importance of building team trust. We provide detailed information about our course structure, lessons learned, and propose recommendations for other universities and programs. Our work concerns educators interested in launching similar capstone projects so that students in other institutions can reap the beneﬁts of large-scale, multi-team development.},

	abstract = {Sustainable computing is a rapidly growing research area spanning several areas of computer science. In the software engineering ﬁeld, the topic has received increasing attention in recent years, with several studies addressing a range of concerns. However, few studies have demonstrated the awareness of software practitioners about the underlying concepts of sustainability in the software development practice. In this eﬀect, in this study, we aim to provide some evidence about the practitioners’ perception about the adoption of sustainability in software development, under four main perspectives: economic, social, environmental and technical. To accomplish such a goal, we carried out a survey study with twentyﬁve software engineers involved in projects in diﬀerent domains. The yielded results indicate an overall lack of knowledge about the topic, in particular regarding the concepts about sustainable software, although it is a common understanding that sustainability should be treated as a quality attribute and should support the interaction between sustainability and the software development life cycle phases. Among the observed perspectives, the respondents indicate that the technical dimension is the most relevant and explored so far. This study contributes to the ﬁeld with initial evidence and can be seen as a ﬁrst step towards establishing a common understanding about how the software industry is receptive to the use of sustainability concepts in software development practices.},

	abstract = {Software Engineering has faced several challenges in the last decade, especially those related to aspects beyond the technical side. As such, technological, organizational and social aspects should be considered altogether in research and practice in the ﬁeld so that complexity could be handled in order to provide solution to the existing problems from the software industry demands. In this context, systems-of-systems (SoS) and software ecosystems (SECO) emerged as topics that joined researchers and practitioners interested in understanding how to manage and engineer software-intensive systems within modern, complex, distributed, dynamic, and open environments. An SoS comprises independent constituent systems which work together to fulﬁll missions driven by architectural concerns. In turn, a SECO consists of a set of actors and artifacts, as well as their relationships, to produce value over a common technology platform driven by external contributions. Both classes of systems have a distributed nature, focus on optimizing the cost-beneﬁt trade-oﬀ, and aim to reach global markets. In this special section, we introduce extended versions of two papers selected from the 10th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-ofSystems and Software Ecosystems (SESoS 2022). These articles provide researchers and practitioners with advances on the development and evolution of complex software-intensive systems.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm that has been applied to various domains, including machine learning, scientific computing, video processing, etc. To develop serverless computing-based software applications (a.k.a., serverless applications), developers follow the new cloud-based software architecture, where they develop event-driven applications without the need for complex and error-prone server management. The great demand for developing serverless applications poses unique challenges to software developers. However, Software Engineering (SE) has not yet wholeheartedly tackled these challenges. In this paper, we outline a vision for how SE can facilitate the development of serverless applications and call for actions by the SE research community to reify this vision. Specifically, we discuss possible directions in which researchers and cloud providers can facilitate serverless computing from the SE perspective, including configuration management, data security, application migration, performance, testing and debugging, etc.},

It presents computer science as a cutting-edge technological discipline that empowers them to solve problems of personal interest (socially relevant with a “little s”), as well as problems that are important to society at large (socially relevant with a “capital s”). We believe that socially relevant computing offers a vision of computer science that has the potential to improve the quantity, quality and diversity of students in our discipline.

	abstract = {As software engineering research becomes more concerned with the psychological, sociological and managerial aspects of software development, relevant theories from reference disciplines are increasingly important for understanding the field’s core phenomena of interest. However, the degree to which software engineering research draws on relevant social sciences remains unclear. This study therefore investigates the use of social science theories in five influential software engineering journals over 13 years. It analyzes not only the extent of theory use but also what, how and where these theories are used. While 87 different theories are used, less than two percent of papers use a social science theory, most theories are used in only one paper, most social sciences are ignored, and the theories are rarely tested for applicability to software engineering contexts. Ignoring relevant social science theories may (1) undermine the community’s ability to generate, elaborate and maintain a cumulative body of knowledge; and (2) lead to oversimplified models of software engineering phenomena. More attention to theory is needed for software engineering to mature as a scientific discipline.},

However, the life-span of modern devices is commonly very short, due to their lack of long-term maintainability in both hardware and software. This yields an increased amount of e-waste, as the individual devices are commonly very cheap and can therefore easily be replaced in case of (partial) obsolescence. In this work, we show an operating system architecture which is designed to make embedded systems more sustainable and prepared for long-term use. To do so, we implement a general basic architecture alongside extended concepts and special features within the operating system. Our approach is based on hardware/software co-design and the opportunity to update software as well as hardware in a modular way at runtime. Therefore, logic reconfiguration of the host platform, dynamic software composition and integration, as well as formal methods for verification and portability are supported.},

	abstract = {Systematic literature reviews represent an important methodology in EvidenceBased Software Engineering. To define the methodological route in these type of studies, in which a review of quantitative and qualitative aspects of primary studies is carried out to summarize the existing information regarding a particular topic, researchers use protocols that guide the construction of knowledge from research questions. This article presents a process that uses forward Snowballing, which identifies the articles cited in the paper under study and the number of citations as inclusion criteria to complement systematic literature reviews. A process that relies on software tools was designed to apply the Snowballing strategy and to identify the most cited works and those who cite them. To validate the process, a review identified in the literature was used. After comparing the results, new works that were not taken into account but made contributions to the subject of study emerged. The citation index represents the number of times a publication has been referenced in other documents and is used as a mechanism to analyze, measure, or quantitatively assess the impact of said publication on the scientific community. The present study showed how applying Snowballing along with other strategies enables the emergence of works that may be relevant for an investigation given the citations rate. That is, implementing this proposal will allow updating or expanding systematic literature studies through the new works evidenced.},

As a result, several researchers have examined security solutions as early as the requirement engineering phase. With the growth of the software business and the internet, there is a need to understand the security risks against each phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC). This study aims to empirically investigate and prioritize the risks that could negatively impact the software security aspects of SDLC in the context of global software development (GSD). To achieve the study objectives, we conducted an industrial empirical study to determine the impact of software security threats against each phase of SDLC. Furthermore, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) was used to prioritize the list of software security risks against the SDLC. The results and analysis of this study provide a ranked-based decision-making framework, which assists the practitioners in considering the most critical security risks on priority. The results show “improper plan for secure requirement identification, inception, authentication, authorization, and privacy,” “lack of threat models updating,” “lack of output validation,” “lack of certification in the final release and archive,” and “spoofing” as the top-ranked security risks of SDLC in GSD. In addition, the application of FAHP is novel in this domain as it is helpful to address multicriteria decision-making problems.},

At the same time, most trafﬁc classiﬁcation efforts stop once they correctly label a ﬂow as web or HTTP. In this paper, we focus on understanding what happens “under the hood” of HTTP trafﬁc. Our ﬁrst contribution is ReSurf, a systematic approach to reconstruct web-surﬁng activity starting from raw network data with more than 91\% recall and 95\% precision over four real network traces. Our second contribution is an extensive analysis of web activity across these traces. By utilizing ReSurf, we study web-surﬁng behaviors in terms of user requests and transitions between websites (e.g. the click-through history of following hyperlinks). A surprising result is the prevalence of advertising and tracking services that are being accessed during web-surﬁng that are without the user’s explicit consent. In our traces, we found that with 90\% chance a user will access such a service after just three user requests (or “clicks”). We believe that our methodology and ﬁndings provide valuable insights into modern trafﬁc that can allow: (a) network administrators to better manage and protect their networks, (b) trafﬁc regulators to protect the rights of on-line users, and (c) researchers to better understand the evolution of the trafﬁc from modern websites.},

The traditional software engineering process causes negative influences on the environment, economy and to society. For instance, the energy consumption during the software processing is considered as a first order impact because it directly leads to high costs on energy bills and consequently on the environment. Moreover, the optimization of a process implementation and software development can lead to second order impacts, also referred to as indirect impacts. Finally, the third other impact considers the user’s behaviors and consciousness regarding the concept of sustainability. In order to mitigate these negative impacts, the purpose of this research is to identify, via systematic literature review, the practices of sustainable software engineering reported by the academy applied in the industry. Through the systematic literature review, it was possible to discover 170 practices in which 70 were related to practices of energy consumption that could be adopted during the software development. Our results indicate that those practices emerged from the grounded theory, which are part of SWEBOK areas and are applicable in the industry.},

For PbD to be a viable option, it is important to understand developers’ perceptions, interpretation and practices as to informational privacy (or data protection). To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with 27 developers from different domains, who practice software design. Grounded analysis of the data revealed an interplay between several different forces affecting the way in which developers handle privacy concerns. Borrowing the schema of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we classified and analyzed the cognitive, organizational and behavioral factors that play a role in developers’ privacy decision making. Our findings indicate that developers use the vocabulary of data security to approach privacy challenges, and that this vocabulary limits their perceptions of privacy mainly to third-party threats coming from outside of the organization; that organizational privacy climate is a powerful means for organizations to guide developers toward particular practices of privacy; and that software architectural patterns frame privacy solutions that are used throughout the development process, possibly explaining developers’ preference of policy-based solutions to architectural solutions. Further, we show, through the use of the SCT schema for framing the findings of this study, how a theoretical model of the factors that influence developers’ privacy practices can be conceptualized and used as a guide for future research toward effective implementation of PbD.},

However, these challenges may become more complicated for certain groups of researchers rather than others. For instance, junior researchers who make up a large group of the current scientific community, particularly in the computer science domain, may face various types of impediments. A notable hindrance to realizing the impediments is the difficulty of precisely delineating them. In this paper, we report an empirical investigation to measure the level of awareness of any kind of obstacles that might hinder junior researchers’ publishing ability and disturb their involvement. For this purpose, we conducted a survey targeting active researchers from the Software Engineering field with a total of 52 respondents. We mainly focus on two types of aspects: peer reviewing models and collaboration. Our findings indicate that junior researchers seem to be more comfortable with double-blind reviewing models with more than half (approximately 67.2\%) of them voting in favor of this model. The results also show a significant agreement that a lack of experience especially in academic writing and supervision problems constitute the most influential barriers to publishing. Our findings can help understand the needs of junior researchers and provide insights into our research community and its specific groups.},

In CBSS development, it is common to identify software modules ﬁrst. Once they are determined, we need to select appropriate software components for each software module. However, very few research works so far have addressed the theoretical aspect especially in the optimization of software component selection for CBSS development. Previous studies of CBSS development seldom considered the inﬂuence of software components on coupling and cohesion of software modules. In this paper, the formulation of an optimization model of software components selection for CBSS development is described. The model has two objectives: maximizing the functional performance of the CBSS and maximizing the cohesion and minimizing the coupling of software modules. A genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to solve the optimization model for determining the optimal selection of software components for CBSS development. An example of developing a ﬁnancial system for small- and medium-size enterprises is used to illustrate the proposed methodology.},

Each of the approaches has certain exclusive principles, practices, thinking, and values, which are informally represented, implemented, and improperly institutionalized. Ontologies are developed for the representation, assessment, and adaptation of SDAs separately without having a shared terminology which may lead to terminological conflict and confusion affecting the simultaneous representation and implementation in software development industry and academia. The software engineering approaches does not consider and support sustainability as priority concern. However, the approaches have capabilities of supporting sustainable software development in different sustainability aspects. This research article aims for the designing and development of an integrated ontology of software engineering approaches (i.e., agile, lean, and green) named OntoSuSD (ontology for sustainable software development) to support sustainable software development knowledge, awareness, and implementation. The goal of OntoSuSD is to propose, design and develop a formal, generic, consistent, and shared knowledge base containing semantic terminology and description of concepts and relationships generated around the representation and implementation of lean, agile, and green approaches in software development processes, which will facilitate their simultaneous implementation and assessment for sustainable software development. The OntoSuSD is developed using practical ontology engineering methodology by reusing relevant ontologies and explicit concepts and properties are defined to fulfill knowledge requirements and representations of the domain. The OntoSuSD is evaluated, and results infer OntoSuSD has high ontological design, good domain coverage, potential applications and achieves purpose of the ontology development.},

	title = {On {Reliability} and {Flexibility} of {Scientific} {Software} in {Environmental} {Science} : {Towards} a {Systematic} {Approach} to {Support} {Decision} {Making}},
	abstract = {Scientific software, and more specifically simulation models, are crucial to support decision makers in deciding what is the better action to take to anticipate and tackle environmental issues such as climate change. However, their complexity make them hardly usable in such context as their execution is time-consuming or resource-demanding, which is the result of the primary goal of elaborating and using them for research. Therefore, there is a need to speed up their execution to make them match the requirements of the new context that is the support of decision making. As the context of supporting decision making by exploring the multiple scenarios (i.e., climate scenarios, geographical sites, potential solutions to enact) does not require very specific and detailed results, but rather a global risk assessment of the climate related events (e.g., risk of flooding caused by the rise of the sea level and the underground water), a trade-off between accuracy and execution speed can be performed. Several approaches to do so exist but are not satisfying as they are either timeconsuming or resource-demanding. Only the approximate computing approach seems relevant to the context, but it is not adapted to scientific software. Thus, in this thesis, we aim to tailor scientific models to support decision making in environmental science by adapting approximate computing for them while ensuring their reliability. Before performing the trade-off and tailoring, we investigate the complementarity of engineering and scientific models as well as the specificities of scientific models with regard to their validation. We propose the use of the MODA framework that helps to understand and visualize how models and data are integrated into a cyber-physical system and how they interact with each other according to the role they play. We also look at the validation of the scientific models and we propose a scientific V-Model that highlights the importance of appropriate tools to ensure the development of reliable scientific software. The main contribution applies the guidelines introduced in the previous contributions to provide an approach, called loop aggregation, to systematically and automatically perform a trade-off between accuracy and speed for scientific models in the context of supporting decision making while ensuring their fidelity. We implement and validate the approach with a hydraulic model assessing the risk of flooding in the region of Normandy, France. We show that a speed-up of more than 95\% can be obtained. Lastly, we investigate the optimisation of applying loop aggregation. We propose a data-driven based optimisation approach that aims to predict the conditions leading to the optimal trade-off for the exploration of new scenarios. We validate the approach with the same hydraulic model used in the main contribution and we quantify the potential error introduced by the prediction that the surrogate model can generate. We also examine the variability present in the approach and inspect several factors that can help improve the optimisation as a preliminary study. Overall, this thesis focuses on the challenges of using scientific software to support decision making in environmental-related issues, and shows that, thanks to understanding what role the scientific model plays in the decision-making process, as well as the need for specific validation of the scientific model, the loop aggregation technique, and its associated optimisation, is a valid solution to tackle those challenges.},

	abstract = {The abundance of complex natural language descriptions related to requirements data presents major challenges for requirement analysis. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as the latest achievement in symbolic studies, are widely used in various fields due to their rich semantic expressive abilities. However, existing methods that mine resource description framework (RDF) triples in classical KGs cannot effectively capture the fuzzy semantic information in the product development system. To address this, we propose a multicriteria requirement ranking method based on uncertain knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR). First, we defined a model for representing uncertain knowledge to organize diverse data from multiple sources. This process was accomplished by constructing the requirement ontology, which is based on the function-behaviourstructure (FBS) model and requirements modelling-related documents. Next, a knowledge representation approach named the fuzzy requirement knowledge graph (FRKG) was devised by combining attribute confidence and predicate fuzziness. Then, knowledge reasoning rules were designed to enhance the edges in the FRKG, unveiling potential relationships between nodes. Utilizing the enriched FRKG (EFRKG), we proposed a multicriteria requirement ranking method based on grey relational analysis (GRA). To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conducted a case study involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, the semantic extension capability of FRKG was evaluated, and a comparison with traditional multicriteria requirement ranking methods was performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach from both perspectives.},

Concretely, our approach adopts a two-layer architecture including OS-level and process-level energy monitoring. OSlevel energy monitoring estimates the energy consumption of processes according to different hardware devices (CPU, network card). Process-level energy monitoring focuses on Java-based applications and builds on OS-level energy monitoring to provide an estimation of energy consumption at the granularity of classes and methods. We argue that this per-method analysis of energy consumption provides better insights to the application in order to identify potential energy hotspots. In particular, our preliminary validation demonstrates that we can monitor energy hotspots of Jetty web servers and monitor their variations under stress scenarios.},

One of the most critical processes in CBSD is the selection of a set of software components from in-house or external repositories that fulﬁl some architectural and user-deﬁned requirements. However, there is a lack of quality models and metrics that can help evaluate the quality characteristics of software components during this selection process. This paper presents a set of measures to assess the Usability of software components, and describes the method followed to obtain and validate them. Such a method can be re-used as a pattern for deﬁning and validating measures for further quality characteristics.},

This paper presents a sustainable software engineering framework, named as LAGSSE, by integrating the Agile, Lean and Green approaches. The framework is based on the “OntoSuSD” ontology to represent the diverse Agile, Lean and Green approaches for achieving the software sustainability dimensions, goals, and enablers. The proposed framework is validated using the Delphi method using the expert opinion scenario which has proved LAGSSE as an efficient framework for supporting sustainable software development. The LAGSSE framework is aimed to facilitate the software developers, academia, experts, and policy makers in the software industry, institutions, and government to make policies and develop sustainable software products according to their software sustainability goals and requirements.},

	abstract = {This research seeks to investigate the effects of a Group Model Building approach on the sustainability knowledge base prior to the weighting of design requirements. Current practice shows that the knowledge about sustainability impacts and implications on other design objectives often is limited and dispersed among decision-makers. Including sustainability criteria in needs and requirements, therefore, tend to rely on limited knowledge and decision-support, leading to decision-makers often prioritizing design objectives that they are more experienced with. The aim of this research was to capture and discuss effects on team alignment of contextual sustainability understanding from co-modeling impacts and implications of sustainability on other design objectives. The research question guiding the study is ‘what are the effects of a group model building approach on early sustainability design decisions?’. A mixed-methods research, structured according to four assumptions, was designed to analyze effects quantitatively and qualitatively. The assumptions were that the proposed approach helps design teams foster an improved contextual sustainability understanding, align the view of the relative importance of sustainability, identify suitable sustainability improvement, and increase the knowledge maturity of their design decisions. The results triangulation showed that the participants showed signs of improved sustainability understanding of their design projects and that improvement actions were identified from applying the approach. A statistically relevant converging effect could be found on the team alignment of the weighting of sustainability criteria but not on the knowledge maturity. These findings are discussed to conclude on main contributions, limitations, and areas for future work.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development as a research topic is becoming more prevalent across different fields. From a computer science perspective sustainability can incorporate anything from how to develop low-resource-use algorithms to human-computer-interaction oriented applications for behavior change. Eco-feedback systems is the collective term for solutions that can give consumers feedback regarding the environmental impact from their product use. This thesis explores how Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) and ecofeedback can be merged for a digital context, i.e. during the use of computers and software. Two design prototypes were developed where one was considered neutral and the other had PSD applied. As one aim of the thesis was to investigate how different designs affect people and if demographic and personal differences have any effect on the result, these designs were distributed in different questionnaires to measure the persuasive potential and user opinions. Further on, the PSD prototype was used in a usability test and short interview with the intention to gather more opinions in addition to the survey. The results show no significant difference in the response towards the neutral against the persuasive systems design. In total the perceived ease of use and usability score high, meaning the participants regard the design to be easy to use. The response differs greatly when it comes to usefulness and intention to use a similar system in the future. The results of this thesis give an indication of where the user interest is currently at. However, further evaluation and more research is necessary to develop stronger conclusions regarding how different users perceive eco-feedback systems.},

Any software system's foundation is its architecture, which provides a mechanism for reasoning about key software quality needs. Their long-term viability —the ability to adapt to changing circumstances – is a major problem in software architecture study and practice. As part of the entire software design and development process, accidental software complexity accumulates progressively over time. This allows several issues to overlap from a software architecture perspective, including, but not limited to: the accumulation of technical debt design decisions of individual components and systems leading to coupling and cohesion issues; the application of tacit architectural knowledge resulting in unsystematic and undocumented design decisions; architectural knowledge vaporization of design choices and the organization's continued ability to understand the aforementioned as to accomplish efficient and effective maintenance and evolutionary change, sustainable software architectures must evolve over the whole lifecycle of the system, from basic design genesis to end-of-life. To give a context and terminology for structuring the discourse on software architectures and sustainability, this article provides general ideas and perspectives on sustainability in relation to software systems. It summarizes some of the recent research trends and techniques with regards to explicitly addressing sustainability in the context of software architectures, with a focus on the capability of software architectures and architectural design decisions to endure through time. The primary goal of this article is to give a foundation and roadmap for future research themes in the field of sustainable software architectures, covering recent trends as well as unresolved issues and research problems.},

Direct effects are caused by the production, use and disposal of information and communication technology (ICT) hardware. Indirect effects include the changes to patterns of production and consumption in other domains. Studies quantifying both effects often conclude that net effects (indirect minus direct effects) can lead to a significant GHG emission reduction. We revisited a study by Accenture on ICT’s GHG abatement potential in Switzerland by reassessing the main assumptions. Our results confirm that ICT has the potential to reduce GHG emissions in Switzerland, especially in the building, transport and energy domains. However, our results also suggest that the potential is smaller than anticipated and that exploiting this potential requires targeted action. Reasons for differences among these results (and the results of similar other studies) are: degrees of freedom in the assessment methodology, selection of ICT use cases, allocation of impacts to ICT, definition of the baseline, estimation of the environmental impact, prediction of the future adoption of use cases, estimation of rebound effects, interaction among use cases, and extrapolation from use case to society-wide impacts. We suggest addressing these methodological challenges to improve comparability of results.},

In recent years, this has been coupled with the increasing popularity of outsourcing and offshoring software development. These are two significant issues, which need to be considered and recognized. As educators, it is important that we prepare our students, at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level to make informed and meaningful contributions to the industry they plan to enter. To facilitate this we need to consider providing modules that outline the benefits and problems associated with globally distributed software development. As research has identified, a key element of any such module is the importance and impact that cultural diversity plays. To facilitate understanding in this area, students can benefit from knowledge of the literature on culture. This can provide essential information which allows them to understand the broader aspects of this important topic. In this paper, global software development and culture are placed in context. A summary of relevant literature with respect to culture is presented and discussed.

	abstract = {In cyber-physical systems such as robots and automated vehicles that rely heavily on batteries, safety, and energy conservation can result conflicting requirements when not considered together. In systems engineering, the development begins at a concept phase where we have high-level information of different components of the system. During the concept phase, we perform hazard analysis and risk assessment, define safety goals, and derive safety requirements. This means requirement engineering occurs at the end of the concept phase. However, energy conservation recommendations are not taken into consideration until the detailed design with specific hardware and software is known. Hence, it is possible to recommend energy conservation behaviors that can compromise system's safety. If we perform a trade-off analysis between safety and energy conservation at a concept phase, we can propose various design alternatives and choose the best one that offers a safe and energy saving architecture. To achieve this goal, we propose an approach for identifying safety issues that can be caused by energy conservation recommendations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we performed an empirical study on four robotic systems. Our results show that we can find energy conservation recommendations that can compromise safety at a concept phase.},

	abstract = {Continuous developments in data science have brought forth an exponential increase in complexity of machine learning models. Additionally, data scientists have become ubiquitous in the private market and academic environments. All of these trends are on a steady rise, and are associated with an increase in power consumption and associated carbon footprint. The increasing carbon footprint of large-scale advanced data science has already received attention, but the latter trend has not. This work aims to estimate the contribution of the increasingly popular ‘‘common’’ data science to the global carbon footprint. To this end, the power consumption of several typical tasks in the aforementioned common data science tasks are measured and compared to: large-scale ‘‘advanced’’ data science, common computer-related tasks, and everyday noncomputer related tasks. An automated data science project is also run on various hardware architectures. To assess its sustainability in terms of carbon emission, the measurements are converted to gCO2eq and an equivalent unit of ‘‘km driven by car’’. Our main findings are: ‘‘common’’ data science consumes 2.57 more power than regular computer usage, but less than some common everyday power-consuming tasks such as lighting or heating; advanced data science consumes substantially more power than common data science, and can be either on par or vastly surpass common everyday power-consuming tasks, depending on the scale of the project. In addition to the reporting of these results, this work also aims to inspire researchers to include power usage and estimated carbon emission as a secondary result in their work.},

              Design/methodology/approach
              The paper presents a discursive analysis of the skills and knowledge requirements of an emerging green knowledge‐based economy using a range of policy focussed and academic research literature.
            
            
              Findings
              The business opportunities that are emerging as a more sustainable world is developed requires the knowledge and skills that can capture and move then forward but in a complex and uncertain worlds learning needs to non‐linear, creative and emergent.
            
            
              Practical implications
              Sustainable learning and the attributes graduates will need to exhibit are prefigured in the activities and learning characterising the work and play facilitated by new media technologies.
            
            
              Social implications
              Greater emphasis is required in higher learning understood as the capability to learn, adapt and direct sustainable change requires interprofessional co‐operation that must utlise the potential of new media technologies to enhance social learning and collective intelligence.

	abstract = {Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE.
Method: To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example.
Results: The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations.
Conclusion: Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences.},

Green IT initiatives refer to the need to reduce the impact of technology on the environment. However, the policies, strategies, practices, and models of Green IT applied in SMEs over time has to be explored to know their level of implementation. This research aims to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to determine the practices, strategies, policies, and models of Green IT for SMEs. Several studies have been raised regarding Green IT during the last few years and are now compiled in this study. The methodology used was Kitchenham’s, which allowed the extraction of 38 articles from the scientific databases IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science. The results revealed practices, strategies, policies, and models promoting Green IT compliance in SMEs, reducing costs in companies by optimizing technological resources to environmental sustainability.},

	abstract = {The carbon footprint of the world’s Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is growing at an alarming rate, giving rise to calls for tools and methodologies for reporting on carbon emissions towards greater accountability within the sector. Accurately calculating the emissions of digital technologies is a complex task where there are no clear standards for methodologies or boundaries for what should be included in these calculations. Nevertheless, a number of online carbon calculators exist to quantify carbon emissions of ICT. The starting question in this paper is how much such tools can inform and provide insight to people working with ICT innovation to take action to reduce the environmental impacts from the products, services and systems they create. To explore this question, we analyse ICT carbon calculators from a digital innovation designer's perspective, exploring what they enable those creating ICT to see and understand, as well as the limitations of these views on carbon. We argue that these approaches are limited and that a better way to address the issue is by moving from designing carbon calculators to codesigning a framework for responsible innovation that enables systems thinking, exposes complexities, helps with the assessment of carbon emissions without fixating on numbers, and supports evaluation and visualisation of future scenarios.},

            Crowdsource software development has become more and more popular in recent years in the software industry. Crowdsourcing is an open‐call technique for outsourcing tasks to a broad and undefined crowd. Crowdsourcing provides numerous advantages including reduced costs, fast project completion, talent identification, diversity of solutions, top‐quality, and access to problem‐solving creativity. Despite of the benefits gained from crowdsourcing, there are numerous issues like lack of experienced workers, lack of confidentiality, copyright issues, software sustainability, and so forth. There is also less focus on the long‐term sustainability of software development because of new ideas emerging in crowdsourcing software development. Furthermore, in literature, lack of guidelines towards sustainable software crowdsourcing is highlighted as one of the limitations in the software standards. This study aims to identify the factors that influence sustainability aspects in crowdsourced software development. We have conducted a systematic literature review for identification of these factors. In this paper, we present findings of the systematic literature review in the form of a list of 11 factors extracted from a sample of 45 finally selected papers. Among these factors, six of the factors are ranked as critical factors. These critical factors are “Lack of coding standard in documentation,” “Use of popular programming tools,” “Crowd Lack of knowledge and awareness about sustainability,” “Energy‐efficient coding,” “Lack of awareness about sustainable software engineering practices,” and “Lack of coordination/communication between client and crowd.”},

	abstract = {Background: The rise of machine learning (ML) systems has exacerbated their carbon footprint due to increased capabilities and model sizes. However, there is scarce knowledge on how the carbon footprint of ML models is actually measured, reported, and evaluated. Aims: This paper analyzes the measurement of the carbon footprint of 1,417 ML models and associated datasets on Hugging Face. Hugging Face is the most popular repository for pretrained ML models. We aim to provide insights and recommendations on how to report and optimize the carbon efficiency of ML models. Method: We conduct the first repository mining study on the Hugging Face Hub API on carbon emissions and answer two research questions: (1) how do ML model creators measure and report carbon emissions on Hugging Face Hub?, and (2) what aspects impact the carbon emissions of training ML models? Results: Key findings from the study include a stalled proportion of carbon emissions-reporting models, a slight decrease in reported carbon footprint on Hugging Face over the past 2 years, and a continued dominance of NLP as the main application domain reporting emissions. The study also uncovers correlations between carbon emissions and various attributes, such as model size, dataset size, ML application domains and performance metrics. Conclusions: The results emphasize the need for software measurements to improve energy reporting practices and the promotion of carbonefficient model development within the Hugging Face community. To address this issue, we propose two classifications: one for categorizing models based on their carbon emission reporting practices and another for their carbon efficiency. With these classification proposals, we aim to encourage transparency and sustainable model development within the ML community.},

	abstract = {Energy efficiency of software systems has been investigated by the Software Engineering research community along different aspects. For example, conceptual frameworks and guidelines have been defined to help increase stakeholders’ awareness about energy efficiency; design patterns and tactics have been proposed to guide software system architects when evaluating possible alternative solutions; and techniques for collecting energy consumption data while the software is running have been developed. Research on practical methods and tools at support of requirements engineering for the development of software that meets energy efficiency requirements is still limited. In this research preview, we introduce an approach that exploits goal-oriented requirements models and software testing to explore critical scenarios for energy consumption, and identify model factors that may recur when energy consumption is greater, we call them "model indicators" of energy consumption. Techniques for performing energy consumption measurements of running software are used. The resulting method connects artefacts at requirements and run-time levels. The identified model indicators can contribute to the prediction of energy consumption of software at requirements level, thus increasing energy awareness of the analysts and developers, and support them to take more energy-friendly decisions during software development and evolution. We describe this method with the help of an illustrative example. Next steps in the proposed research are presented.},

	abstract = {Background. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platforms have known multiple evolutions along the last decades to enhance both the performance they exhibit and the features they offer. With regards to energy consumption, few studies have investigated the energy consumption of code and data structures. Yet, we keep missing an evaluation of the energy efficiency of existing JVM platforms and an identification of the configurations that minimize the energy consumption of software hosted on the JVM. Aims. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the variations in energy consumption between different JVM distributions and parameters to help developers configure the least consuming environment for their Java application.
Method. We thus assess the energy consumption of some of the most popular and supported JVM platforms using 12 Java benchmarks that explore different performance objectives. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the different JVM parameters and configurations on the energy consumption of software.
Results. Our results show that some JVM platforms can exhibit up to 100\% more energy consumption. JVM configurations can also play a substantial role to reduce the energy consumption during the software execution. Interestingly, the default configuration of the garbage collector was energy efficient in only 50\% of our experiments.
Conclusion. Finally, we provide an Open source tool, named JReferral that recommends an energy-efficient JVM distribution and configuration for any Java application.},

To develop sustainability-aware software, green metrics have been implemented to estimate the energy consumed by the execution of an application. However, they have a rebound energy consumption effect because they require an application to be executed to estimate the energy consumed after each change. To address this problem, it is necessary to construct energy estimation models that do not require the execution of applications. This work addresses this problem by constructing a green model based on size, complexity and duplicated lines to estimate the energy consumed by model-view-controller applications without their execution. This article defines a model constructed based on 52 applications. The results were accurate in twelve applications, which showed that the joule estimation was very close to reality, avoiding the energy consumed by the execution of applications.},

Using dynamic server provisioning, the number of servers that serve requests can be reduced by turning off idle servers and thereby saving energy. However, such a scheme, usually increases the risk of instability of server queues. In this work, we analyze the trade-off between energy usage and stability of servers in a data center when we balance the load by dispatching arriving jobs. We propose algorithms to solve a stability and energy objective stochastic optimization problem with a high degree of ﬂexibility to handle the trade-off between these two objectives. We consider variable size jobs to apply load balancing on selected active servers and ﬁnd that the optimal solution is an NP-hard problem. We therefore develop two computationally efﬁcient greedy and randomized approximation schemes to achieve the trade-off between these objectives. We investigate the performance of our proposed algorithms in minimizing the risk of queue length growth as well as the number of active servers needed to serve jobs, and compare it with several metrics in heterogeneous load scenarios.},

	abstract = {When planning, creating, and evolving systems throughout their lifecycle, it is essential to assess their impact on our world. Despite this pressing need, existing structured methods for systematically assessing social, economic, and environmental impacts are not related to targets of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. Moreover, existing Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) lack concepts and tooling for sustainability assessment. Our aim is to allow modeling systems, their sustainability properties, and sustainability questions in a structured manner for a wide domain. This paper proposes the engineering and design of a domain-specific language for sustainability assessment embedded into ADLs and showcases its use for evaluating a citizen energy community system as a case study. We discuss possibilities on how to use such models in their further processing and explore challenges in technical realization. This initial step towards standardizing the sustainability assessments of modeled systems throughout the development is both comprehensive and formal so that developers can make informed, sustainable decisions based on consequence assessments upfront.},

One major issue for the government and private sector is the selection of appropriate OSS. This paper uses new internal quality characteristics for selecting OSS that can be added to the dimensions of DeLone and McLean information systems’ model. Through this study, the quality characteristics are organized in a two level hierarchy, which list characteristics and sub-characteristics that are interconnected with three main dimensions: system quality, information quality and service quality. These characteristic dimensions are tailored to the criteria having been built from literature study and standard for software quality and guidelines. This paper presents case study results of applying the proposed quality characteristic on eight different open source software that are divided between open source network tools and learning management systems.},

Power simulators, combined with a full-system architectural simulator such as gem5, enable power-performance trade-offs to be investigated early in the design of a system with different conﬁgurations (e.g number of cores, cache size, etc.). However, the accuracy of existing power simulators, such as McPAT, is known to be low due to the abstraction and speciﬁcation errors, and this can lead to incorrect research conclusions. In this paper, we present an accurate power model, built from measured data, integrated into gem5 for estimating the power consumption of a simulated quad-core ARM CortexA15. A power modelling methodology based on Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) is used to build and evaluate the integrated model in gem5. We ﬁrst validate this methodology on the real hardware with 60 workloads at nine Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) levels and four core mappings (2,160 samples), showing an average error between estimated and real measured power of less than 6\%. Correlation between gem5 activity statistics and hardware PMCs is investigated to build a gem5 model representing a quad-core ARM Cortex-A15. Experimental validation with 15 workloads at four DVFS levels on real hardware and gem5 has been conducted to understand how the difference between the gem5 simulated activity statistics and the hardware PMCs affects the estimated power consumption.},

However, limited studies are available about the elicitation of impact-related information from stakeholders, and strategies are particularly needed to elicit possible longterm effects, including negative ones, that go beyond the planned system goals. This paper reports a case study about the impact of digitalisation in remote mountain areas, in the context of a system for ordinary land management and hydro-geological risk control. The elicitation process was based on interviews and workshops. In the initial phase, past and present impacts were identified. In a second phase, future impacts were forecasted through the discussion of two alternative scenarios: a dystopic, technology-intensive one, and a technology-balanced one. The approach was particularly effective in identifying negative impacts. Among them, we highlight the higher stress due to the excess of connectivity, the partial reduction of decision-making abilities, and the risk of marginalisation for certain types of stakeholders. The study posits that before the elicitation of system goals, requirements engineers need to identify the socio-economic impacts of ICT technologies included in the system, as negative effects need to be properly mitigated. Our study contributes to the literature with: a set of impacts specific to the case, which can apply to similar contexts; an effective approach for impact elicitation; and a list of lessons learned from the experience.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently spearheaded by machine learning (ML) methods such as deep learning (DL) which have accelerated progress on many tasks thought to be out of reach of AI. These ML methods can often be compute hungry, energy intensive, and result in significant carbon emissions, a known driver of anthropogenic climate change. Additionally, the platforms on which ML systems run are associated with environmental impacts including and beyond carbon emissions. The solution lionized by both industry and the ML community to improve the environmental sustainability of ML is to increase the efficiency with which ML systems operate in terms of both compute and energy consumption. In this perspective, we argue that efficiency alone is not enough to make ML as a technology environmentally sustainable. We do so by presenting three high level discrepancies between the effect of efficiency on the environmental sustainability of ML when considering the many variables which it interacts with. In doing so, we comprehensively demonstrate, at multiple levels of granularity both technical and non-technical reasons, why efficiency is not enough to fully remedy the environmental impacts of ML. Based on this, we present and argue for systems thinking as a viable path towards improving the environmental sustainability of ML holistically.},

Yet unresolved is whether the aggregated net effect of ICT overall mitigates or aggravates environmental burdens. While the savings potentials have been explored, drivers that prevent these and possible counter measures have not been researched thoroughly. The concept digital sufficiency constitutes a basis to understand how ICT can become part of the essential environmental transformation. Digital sufficiency consists of four dimensions, each suggesting a set of strategies and policy proposals: (a) hardware sufficiency, which aims for fewer devices needing to be produced and their absolute energy demand being kept to the lowest level possible to perform the desired tasks; (b) software sufficiency, which covers ensuring that data traffic and hardware utilization during application are kept as low as possible; (c) user sufficiency, which strives for users applying digital devices frugally and using ICT in a way that promotes sustainable lifestyles; and (d) economic sufficiency, which aspires to digitalization supporting a transition to an economy characterized not by economic growth as the primary goal but by sufficient production and consumption within planetary boundaries. The policies for hardware and software sufficiency are relatively easily conceivable and executable. Policies for user and economic sufficiency are politically more difficult to implement and relate strongly to policies for environmental transformation in general. This article argues for comprehensive policies for digital sufficiency, which are indispensible if ICT are to play a beneficial role in overall environmental transformation.},

This also applied at the time to academia: Lecturers and those responsible for study programs did not know what should be taught in the different subjects.

However, due to the large number of research groups, measurement setups, procedure models, tools, and general novelty of the research area, a comprehensive research framework has yet to be created. The literature documents several approaches from researchers and practitioners who have developed individual methods and models, along with more general ideas like the integration of software sustainability in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, or science communication approaches to make the resource cost of software transparent to society. However, a reference measurement model for the energy and resource consumption of software is still missing. In this article, we jointly develop the Green Software Measurement Model (GSMM), in which we bring together the core ideas of the measurement models, setups, and methods of over 10 research groups in four countries who have done pioneering work in assessing the environmental impact of software. We briefly describe the different methods and models used by these research groups, derive the components of the GSMM from them, and then we discuss and evaluate the resulting reference model. By categorizing the existing measurement models and procedures and by providing guidelines for assimilating and tailoring existing methods, we expect this work to aid new researchers and practitioners who want to conduct measurements for their individual use cases.},

The use of some software engineering practices such as the definition of quality models can reduce this risk. We defined a process for COTS components selection based on the use of quality models and we started to apply it in academic and industrial cases. The need of having a tool to support this process arose and, although some tools already exist to partially support the involved activities, none of them was suitable enough. Because of this we developed DesCOTS, a software system that embraces several tools that interact to support the different activities of our process. The system has been designed taking into account not only functional concerns but also nonfunctional aspects such as reusability, interoperability and portability.

However, a key challenge is the identification of dependencies among quality requirements, framed as relevant design concerns of a software architecture, due to the multi-dimensional nature of software sustainability and other extrinsic factors (e.g., stakeholders’ subjectivity for understanding quality requirements and their relationships).},

	abstract = {Defects in software may result in system crashes, sluggish performance, or even deadlock, leading to the depletion of valuable resources. Implementing defect prediction can assist quality assurance teams in identifying potential software issues and rationalizing the allocation of testing resources, thereby decreasing the elimination of resources and enhancing software sustainability. Researchers have recently incorporated deep learning into defect prediction, extracting structural-semantic features from codes’ abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, inappropriate node granularity in ASTs may adversely impact the effectiveness of the extracted features. In addition, converting AST nodes into integer vectors may lead to the loss of structure information, resulting in poor model predictive capability. This paper proposes a tree-based encoding method with hybrid granularity for defect prediction to address these challenges. Specifically, five granular selection schemes are extended to generate various ASTs from codes. Subsequently, a tree-based continuous bag-of-words model is utilized to map nodes of ASTs into numeric vector representations that conform to the tree-like structure of codes. The matrices converted from ASTs are then fed into a convolutional neural network to extract program features automatically. Experiments involving 24 versions of open-source projects demonstrate that our method can improve the effectiveness of extracted features in defect prediction tasks.},

The science of software engineering is the utilization of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable methodologies to deal with the development, operation, and maintenance of software and also the investigation of these methodologies which practically means how to apply engineering science to the application of software. Sustainability is turning into an essential point in information technology as commitment of information technology to uphold our Future, and as advancing business sector fragment. The issue of sustainability was not duly accounted for in the conventional and older software engineering field. Software engineers deal with particular themes that need to take into account sustainability, for instance, green IT, efficient algorithms, smart grids, agile practices and knowledge management, yet there does not exist a thorough comprehension of the idea of sustainability and if it can be incorporated to software engineering. Information communication technology hugely affects sustainable improvements because of its rising popularity for vitality and resource management required when producing hardware and software units. The ranking technique made 374 papers out of 11 different databases. In the wake of performing the exclusion measures, the set was diminished to 97 papers that were clearly identified with the models characterized for performing a composed survey. The purpose of current study is to recognize recent issues in green software engineering and examine the aspect of sustainable and create green software product to render a conceptual model of sustainable software engineering product to wind up even greener. Consequently, we recommend a technique to incorporate sustainability in product life cycle. Then, a conceptual model is rendered demonstrating the consolidated life cycles of sustainable product and principle sustainable measurement dimensions, such as energy or information efficiency, low cost and human health.},

Situating sustainability learning within disciplinary contexts is needed for learners to apply sustainability theory to their future professions. Furthermore, developing capabilities is important to enable graduates to act in differing professional contexts. In response to these needs, this paper contextualises safety as part of sustainability in undergraduate engineering studies by exploring the complementarity between professional capabilities for safety in engineering and key capabilities found in sustainability education literature. The paper draws on findings from interviews with 41 pipeline engineers undertaken to build an understanding of differing views on engineering capabilities necessary for safety decision making. The results show synergies between safety and sustainability capabilities in the context of engineering practice and the opportunities to contextualise safety within sustainability in engineering education. From a safety perspective, given the expanding sustainable development agenda, there is an opportunity to increase education for public safety in engineering curricula within the scope of sustainability education and to shift learning from competencies to capabilities-based outcomes.},

	abstract = {As higher education digitalises, institutions increasingly outsource the development and management of their digital infrastructure including server hardware and services such as email, shared storage, and video conferencing, to private companies. This outsourcing trend is a change in paradigm, since universities have historically been pioneers in deploying and maintaining their own digital infrastructure, a practice also known as self-hosting. Digital infrastructure has a key role in all of a university’s functions: administration, research, and education. While outsourcing infrastructure has benefits in the form of convenience and lower costs, it also erodes institutional independence, centralises points of failure, and delegates highly relevant value choices about privacy, data ownership and environmental impact to external actors. In this article, we provide a first quantification of a potential return to self-hosting, emphasising its effect in energy reduction and avoided e-waste. We then outline some policy actions that could enable higher education institutions to re-take control over their digital infrastructure by building local services. This mode of operation reduces waste, and has the added benefit of increased resilience to scenarios of resource scarcity and collapse of external infrastructure. As an example of what could be achieved leveraging these policies, we detail the architecture of a low-impact data centre made of upcycled hardware and resource-aware software. By exploring our main structural choices we aim to showcase how, even starting from a generally heavy-weight software stack such as Kubernetes, there is significant space to reduce digital infrastructure’s overall resource footprint.},

By the means of the fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis on a sample of 77 countries, we show that 1) a country's ICT profile matters for national sustainability performance, not a single ICT element; 2) national sustainability performance is not (only) about the level of ICT development of a country, but about composition and a quality of its ICT profile; 3) there are multiple distinctive ICT profiles that may lead to high or low sus­ tainability performance (social, economic or environmental) at the national level; and 4) environmental sus­ tainability may have conflicting ICT-related antecedents in comparison to social and economic sustainability. These results offer two primary contributions to research focused on the role of ICTs in supporting (or deterring) sustainable development. First, moving away from simplified perspective of a country's ICT development by focusing on a country's ICT profile allows us to distinguish effects (both positive and negative) of different ICT elements, as well as to take synergies brought by technological convergences into account. This allows us to capture effects of ICT elements in their totality, avoiding to lose richness and comprehensiveness. Second, by focusing on the triple-bottom line sustainability, we add to the growing evidence that environmental-focused goals often conflict with those related to social and economic aspects of sustainable development.},

	title = {Combining {Phenomenology} and {Grounded} {Theory} in {Software} {Engineering}: {An} {Experience}},
	abstract = {Phenomenology and grounded theory are two prominent qualitative methods, particularly used in social sciences research. Phenomenology is carried out to understand the individuals’ actual experience regarding a phenomenon. The method describes "what" individuals experience and "how" they experience it. The focus is on the meaning of the exposures experienced by individuals regarding the phenomenon. Grounded theory on the other hand allows researchers to explore a phenomenon in depth with individuals, by which a theory is then generated. The goal is to go beyond the understanding of phenomenon by producing a theory that describes comprehensively the problem being studied. Although these two methods are initiated by similar motivations, namely to understand a phenomenon, they however employ slightly different approaches during execution. The differences make them fit complementary together to produce a more concrete and holistic outcome. To research that occasionally use qualitative methods such as Software Engineering, these methods bring new and multifaceted experience. Software Engineering research opts for qualitative methods to promote understanding, as many phenomena in the field have yet to be understood by its community. In that respect, grounded theory is becoming quite a norm in Software Engineering research in recent years, phenomenology however is relatively sporadic. This paper shares the experience of employing as well as combining phenomenology and grounded theory in Software Engineering research. The sharing is intended to inspire future research in twofold: more technical fields such as Software Engineering to employ qualitative methods in research; and leveraging the benefits of combining two qualitative methods complementarily in one study.},

Objective: Since ownership metrics studies were done only on industrial software projects, we replicated such a study on Java free/libre and open source software (FLOSS) projects. Our goal was to generalize an “ownership law” that stated that minor developers should be avoided. Method: We explored the relationship between ownership metrics and fault-proneness on seven FLOSS projects, using publicly available corpora to retrieve the fault-related information. Results: In our corpus, the relationship between ownership metrics and module faults is weak. At best, less than half of projects exhibit a signiﬁcant correlation, and at worst, no projects at all. Moreover, fault-proneness seems to be much more inﬂuenced by module size than by ownership. Conclusion: The results of ownership studies done on closed-source projects do not generalize to FLOSS projects. To understand the reasons for that, we performed an in-depth analysis and found that the lack of correlation between ownership metrics and module faults is due to the distributions of contributions among developers and the presence of “heroes” in FLOSS projects.},

	title = {Characterizing {Software} {Energy} {Consumption} in {Mobile} {Application} {Development} to {Support} {Third}-{Party}-{Library} {Selection}},
	abstract = {In recent years, mobile and ubiquitous devices have seen an extensive adoption throughout society. The omnipresence of respective devices has greatly affected mobile software development, as with the limited available energy supplied in a battery powered device, a new quality concern for mobile developers has emerged – energy consumption. Consequently, mobile software development has shifted towards addressing energy consumption as primary non-functional quality aspect during development. However, determining the energy consumption at the level of individual software components is far from trivial. This is why the mobile software engineering research community has spent efforts towards researching methodologies and tools to better comprehend the connection between software design choices and energy consumption.
In this thesis, we focus on a particular aspect relevant to mobile software development, i.e. supporting developers in the process of selecting Third Party Library (TPL) dependencies during development with energy consumption as a primary selection criteria. In particular, in the course of this thesis we present a systematic review on mobile software energy profiling to build a comprehensive foundation of the current state-of-the-art.
Following from the review, we identify challenges relevant to profile energy consumption of software at a fine granularity. We propose a generalized process for a mobile software energy consumption profiling, which at its core evolves around a novel algorithm to decompose a power profile and attribute energy consumption to individual software components. We further show the applicability of the approach
to serve as a blueprint for a mobile software energy profiler using an instantiation thereof. Based on an empirical evaluation, we prove that the approach lies within 0.35\% accuracy of the reference approach. Using an empirical study on the energy efficiency of sorting algorithms on Android, we assess the capabilities of the proposed approach to determine changes in energy consumption at different levels of
granularity. 
We introduce uapi profiles, provide their formal definition and further show how these profiles can be utilized as a proxy for energy consumption and thus provide the foundation for a lightweight assessment of library dependencies regarding their energy characteristics. Consequently, we evaluate the proposed profiles in three different scenarios relevant to selecting library dependencies in the course of the development of Android application. From our results, we first identified a significant positive correlation between the proposed uapi profiles and energy consumption (r 0.95). Second, we determine that the uapi profiles are suitable to compare revisions of a library dependency with an accuracy of 85\%. Third, we show the profile’s capabilities to compare the energy characteristics of thirdparty libraries in an empirical study. In particular, we compare 17 libraries for JSON document processing. Results show that there is a high variety in energy consumption between libraries, which confirms the relevance of the topic addressed
in this thesis. Furthermore, with an overall accuracy of 94.8\% it is shown, that the profiles serve as a valid approach to determine the energy difference between candidate libraries.
This thesis lays the foundation for a lightweight approach to assess the energy characteristics of library dependencies, without requiring any special hardware or alterations to target devices, using a model defined in terms of the platform API utilization from a library dependency. We believe that the approach presented in this thesis could be used to enrich existing library repositories with information on the energy characteristics using the presented uapi profiles and thus providing the foundation for an informed library selection process under consideration of energy consumption and therefore supporting the adaption of mobile development towards sustainable mobile development.},

	abstract = {ICT tools in education are widely used to support the aim of achieving learning outcomes by improving critical areas such as student engagement, participation, and motivation. In this study, we examine literature to explore how game elements are used in capturing students’ interest, which the study suggests is fundamental to the teaching and learning of Software Engineering in higher education. Given the potential of alternative ICT tools such as flipped classrooms to increase interest in learning activities, there is a gap in similar literature on capturing interest in gamified environments, which has the potential to improve the achievement of learning outcomes. We applied flow theory to provide a guiding frame for our study. Following a systematic literature review for our data, we analysed 15 papers from the initial 342 articles, which were extracted from IEEE Xplore and Science Direct databases. The main finding in the reviewed papers underscores the positive impact of gamified learning environments on capturing student interest when teaching and learning Software Engineering. While the reviewed papers were not conclusive in identifying the best game elements for capturing students’ interest, we found, that game elements such as points and leaderboards were the most common mechanisms used to advance students’ interest when studying Software Engineering courses. The findings also suggest that different game elements are used in gamified environments to increase participation and engagement. The paper adds voice to the practical implications of gamification for teaching and learning. Although our study requires empirical evidence to validate our claims, we believe it sets the stage for further discussion. In the future, comparative studies of game elements in similar environments will be beneficial for identifying the ones that are more engaging and assessing their long-term impacts.},

The increasing complexity of Internet of Things (IoT) applications makes energy efﬁciency an important requirement, imposing new challenges to software developers. Software tools capable of providing energy consumption estimations and identifying optimization opportunities are critical during all the phases of application development. This work proposes a novel framework that targets the energy efﬁciency at application development level. The proposed framework is implemented as a single user-friendly tool-ﬂow, providing a variety of useful features, such as the estimation of the energy consumption without the need of executing the application on the targeted IoT devices and the estimation of potential gains by GPU acceleration on modern heterogeneous IoT architectures. The proposed methodology provides several novel contributions, such as the combination of static analysis and dynamic instrumentation approaches in order to exploit the advantages of both. The framework is evaluated on widely used benchmarks, achieving increased estimation accuracy (more than 90\% for similar architectures and more than 72\% for the potential use of the GPU). The effectiveness of the framework is further demonstrated using two industrial use-cases achieving an energy reduction from 91\% up to 98\%.},

Therefore, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate how SE practitioners and researchers approach each other via public LinkedIn discussions and what both sides can contribute to effective science communication. We found that a considerable proportion of LinkedIn posts on SE research are written by people who are not the paper authors (39\%). Further, 71\% of all comments in our dataset are from people in the industry, but only every second post receives at least one comment at all.

The approach taken in most social issues courses is to articulate the social impacts of different computer technologies and then apply macro-ethical theories to those impacts. This paper argues that this approach has a number of drawbacks. First, it is based on a technological deterministic style of social explanation that has been in disrepute in the academic social sciences for decades. Second, it uses an algorithmic approach to ethics that simplifies the social complexity and the uncertainty that is the reality of socio-technological change. It concludes by suggesting that the alternative to the ethical evaluation of impacts is to focus the course instead on the social context; that is, on clarifying and unpacking the complexity involved in the relationship between technology and society.},

	abstract = {The incorporation of sustainability principles during the requirements engineering phase of the development life cycle constitutes greening software requirements. This incorporation can have a variety of effects on the software design employed in modern and cutting-edge information technology (IT) systems. When sustainability principles are incorporated into requirements engineering, software design priorities can change and address current design issues such as energy and resource consumption, modularity, maintainability, and adaptability. In contrast to other green approaches that consider sustainable development, there is a further need to investigate the relationship between software development and the relevant green principles of sustainability during the requirements engineering phase. We present a new mechanism for mapping software nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) to defined dimensions of green software sustainability, consisting of two mapping steps: 1) between NFRs and sustainability dimensions; and 2) between sustainability dimensions and two clusters of green IT aspects defined in this work. The overall architecture of the promising approach is based on the use of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model with an expanded dataset. We consider transfer learning and domainspecific fine-tuning capabilities for constructing and evaluating a model specifically tailored for developing a proof of concept of the greening software requirements engineering task, as language models have recently emerged as a potent technique in the field of software engineering, with numerous applications in code analysis, automated documentation, and code generation. In addition, we test the model’s performance using an extended version of the PROMISE\_exp dataset after adding a new binary classification column for categorizing sustainability dimensions into two defined clusters: Eco-technical and Socioeconomic, and having a selected domain expert label the raw data. The model’s efficiency is evaluated using four matrices—1) accuracy; 2) precision; 3) recall; and 4) F1 score—across a variety of epoch and batch sizes. Our numerical results demonstrate the viability of the approach in text classification tasks via performing well in mapping NFRs to software sustainability dimensions. This acts as a proof of concept for automating the sustainability measurement of software awareness at the early development stage. In addition, the results emphasize the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning and transfer learning for obtaining high performance in classification tasks in requirements engineering.},

This paper observes that, despite a rich body of research in WiFi energy management, there is room for improvement. Our key ﬁnding is that WiFi energy optimizations have conventionally been designed with a single AP in mind. However, network contention among different APs can dramatically increase a client’s energy consumption. Each client may have to keep awake for long durations before its own AP gets a chance to send packets to it. As the AP density increases in the vicinity, the waiting time inﬂates, resulting in a proportional decrease in battery life.},

Minimal distance strategies are frequently adopted to select the components that require minimal adaptation effort.

In this paper we introduce the CODER framework, based on an optimization model, that supports “build-or-buy” decisions in selecting components. The selection criterion is based on cost minimization of the whole assembly subject to constraints on system reliability and delivery time. The CODER framework is composed by: an UML case tool, a model builder, and a model solver. The output of CODER indicates the components to buy and the ones to build, and the amount of testing to be performed on the latter in order to achieve the desired level of reliability.},

The purpose of our study is to support cloud consumers in developing energy-efficient workloads in the public cloud. To achieve our goal, we collaborated with a large cloud solution provider to discover an initial set of reusable architectural tactics for software energy efficiency. Starting from interviews with 17 practitioners, we reviewed and selected available tactics to improve the energy efficiency of individual workloads in the public cloud, and synthetized the identified tactics in a reusable model. In addition, we conducted a case study to assess the impact of utilizing a tactic, which was selected following a prioritization provided by the practitioners. Our results demonstrate the possibility to architect cloud workloads for energy efficiency through reasoning and estimation of resource optimization. However, the process is not (yet) straightforward due to the current lack of transparency of cloud providers.},

Secondary studies aimed at summarizing research on the influences and consequences of such concepts would therefore be of great value. However, the inability to measure abstract concepts directly poses a challenge for secondary studies: primary studies in SE can operationalize such concepts in many ways. Standardized measurement instruments are rarely available, and even if they are, many researchers do not use them or do not even provide a definition for the studied concept. SE researchers conducting secondary studies therefore have to decide a) which primary studies intended to measure the same construct, and b) how to compare and aggregate vastly different measurements for the same construct. In this experience report, we discuss the challenge of study selection in SE secondary research on latent variables. We report on two instances where we found it particularly challenging to decide which primary studies should be included for comparison and synthesis, so as not to end up comparing apples with oranges. Our report aims to spark a conversation about developing strategies to address this issue systematically and pave the way for more efficient and rigorous secondary studies in software engineering.},

	abstract = {Today, Environmental protection and sustainable development are two critical issues. Sustainability is now playing a significant role in almost every aspect of life. Information and communication technology is an integral element in the global economy and international development, with extensive applications in almost all industries. Similarly, software development is an essential component of a rapidly evolving technology community. It is also an important starting point for reducing resource consumption and carbon emissions. Nevertheless, compared to hardware, the software has received inconsiderable attention. The aim of this study is to identify, rank, and determine the importance of factors influencing green software development using a hybrid approach. Five criteria and four subcritical were identified from qualitative content analysis of relevant studies and interviews with twelve academic and industry experts. FDEMATEL was employed to determine the interaction and interrelationships among the identified criteria and sub-criteria while utilizing FANP to calculate the weights of the criteria and their relevant sub-criteria to determine their priorities. The following ranked first to fifth as the most influential factors: operational factor “0.2153”, infrastructure factor “0.2046”, technological factor “0.2006”, individual factor “0.1945”, and the organizational factor “0.1849”. Among the criteria, knowledge, and awareness had the greatest weight of “0.2908“, and ethical factors had the lowest weight of “0.2308”. Given the insignificant difference between the highest and lowest factors, it can be concluded that all factors are almost equally effective. And it can be concluded developing green software requires the creation of a trusted ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The widespread awareness and the sense of urgency and helplessness regarding the ongoing sustainability crisis (climate change, biodiversity loss etc.) can evoke feelings of grief, sorrow, despair and anxiety. Those emotions are seldom discussed in computing or in computing education. They can have detrimental effects on the well-being of students and others, and also lead to inaction. But concern can on the other hand also be a catalyst for learning. In this paper, we present results and reﬂections from a research and development project in our introductory course to sustainability and ICT focusing on emotions in sustainability education. We focus on “eco-anxiety” and ask: 1) How is eco-anxiety communicated by students and teachers?, 2) In what ways do students receive support to deal with eco-anxiety? and 3) What could be done to better address eco-anxiety in computing education? We here present an analysis of how we have responded to the phenomenon of eco-anxiety, what activities have been added to the course and an evaluation of these interventions. The results are based on joint reﬂections that have been guided by literature, a small-scale ethnographic study as well as a course evaluation. The paper will end with recommendations for other ICT4S educators on how they can start addressing eco-anxiety in their education.},

	abstract = {Global warming is one of the most compelling environmental threats today, as the rise in energy consumption and CO2 emission caused a dreadful impact on our environment. The data centers, computing devices, network equipment, etc., consume vast amounts of energy that the thermal power plants mainly generate. Primarily fossil fuels like coal and oils are used for energy generation in these power plants that induce various environmental problems such as global warming ozone layer depletion, which can even become the cause of premature deaths of living beings. The recent research trend has shifted towards optimizing energy consumption and green ﬁelds since the world recognized the importance of these concepts. This paper aims to conduct a complete systematic mapping analysis on the impact of high energy consumption in cloud data centers and its effect on the environment. To answer the research questions identiﬁed in this paper, one hundred nineteen primary studies published until February 2022 were considered and further categorized. Some new developments in green cloud computing and the taxonomy of various energy efﬁciency techniques used in data centers have also been discussed. It includes techniques like VM Virtualization and Consolidation, Power-aware, Bio-inspired methods, Thermal-management techniques, and an effort to evaluate the cloud data center’s role in reducing energy consumption and CO2 footprints. Most of the researchers proposed software level techniques as with these techniques, massive infrastructures are not required as compared with hardware techniques, and it is less prone to failure and faults. Also, we disclose some dominant problems and provide suggestions for future enhancements in green computing.},

Typically, software sustainability needs to be assessed across four dimensions (4D): economic, environmental, social and technical. The current literature lacks information about 4D-sustainability awareness of SA evaluation methods. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review to identify, categorize and characterize SA evaluation methods from 71 primary studies to ascertain their applicability for 4D-sustainability evaluation. Our results show that the majority of the methods are scenario-based, and provide support for technical sustainability but lack 4Dsustainability coverage. We conclude that extending the steps of an existing method for sustainability combined with metric-based modeling of 4D-sustainability QAs can aid in 4D-sustainabilityaware SA evaluation. Also, continuous SA evaluation needs to be explored for the sustainability of SA over time.},

We sought to demonstrate the application of such a process in professional practice. A qualitative case study was conducted in the context of a Dutch airport management company. Data collection involved a case analysis and the execution of two rounds of expert interviews. We (i) identified a set of case-related key performance indicators, (ii) utilized commonly accepted measurement tools, and (iii) employed graphical representations in the form of spider charts to monitor the sustainability impacts. The real-world observations were evaluated through a concluding focus group. Our findings indicated that architecture principles were a feasible mechanism with which to address sustainability across all different architecture layers within the enterprise. The experts considered the sustainability analysis valuable in guiding the software architecture process towards sustainability. With the emphasis on principles, we facilitate industry adoption by embedding sustainability in existing mechanisms.},

The ESC framework includes the entire lifecycle of computing systems, including critical stages such as design, development, monitoring, refactoring, and regulatory compliance. Through the adoption of the ESC framework, academia and industry stakeholders can gain a powerful tool to evaluate and measure sustainability factors across different computing domains and can integrate eco-friendly computing principles and patterns throughout their products and services. This can signiﬁcantly reduce their carbon footprint while complying with environmental regulations. In addition to presenting the ESC framework, the paper showcases real-world use cases. The ﬁrst involves a leading Italian bank, emphasizing the signiﬁcance of monitoring and compliance in achieving sustainable solutions within carbon-aware computing. The second use case explores resource efﬁciency optimization in Kubernetes clusters, illustrating how the ESC framework aligns with cloud infrastructure management trends.},

	abstract = {Data centers consume anywhere between 1.7\% and 2.2\% of the United States’ power. A handful of studies focused on ways of predicting power consumption of computing platforms based on performance events counters. Most of existing power-consumption models retrieve performance counters from hardware, which offer accurate measurement of energy dissipation. Although these models were veriﬁed on several machines with speciﬁc CPU chips, it is difﬁcult to deploy these models into data centers equipped by heterogeneous computing platforms. While models based on resource utilization via OS monitoring tools can be used in heterogeneous data centers, most of these models were linear model. In this paper, we analyze the accuracy of linear models with the SPECpower benchmark results, which is a widely adopted benchmark to evaluate the power and performance characteristics of servers. There are 392 published results until October 2012; these servers represent most servers in heterogeneous data centers. We use R-squared, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and average error to validate the accuracy of the linear model. The results show that not all servers ﬁt the linear model very well. 6.5\% of R-squared values are less than 0.95, which means linear regression does not ﬁt the data very well. 12.5\% of RMSE values are greater than 20, which means there is still big difference between modeled and real power consumption. We extend the linear model to high degree polynomial models. We found the cubic polynomial model can get better results than the linear model. We also apply the linear model and the cubic model to estimate real-time energy consumption on two different servers. The results show that linear model can get accurate prediction value when server energy consumption swing in a small range. The cubic model can get better results for servers with small and wide range.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the use of IoT devices is essential in most sectors along with a rising concern regarding their energy consumption. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the energy consumption of such devices is required for energy-efﬁcient improvements. This paper presents Energy Measurement Model (EMM), an energy estimation tool for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. It is a software-based model used to estimate the local energy consumption of a device by taking into consideration CPU utilization. The error rate of our model averages at 1.25\%. Using this model, we study the energy impact of a set of algorithms, programming languages and compilers.},

	abstract = {A new methodology was created to measure the energy consumption and related green house gas (GHG) emissions of a computer operating system (OS) across different device platforms. The methodology involved the direct power measurement of devices under different activity states. In order to include all aspects of an OS, the methodology included measurements in various OS modes, whilst uniquely, also incorporating measurements when running an array of defined software activities, so as to include OS application management features. The methodology was demonstrated on a laptop and phone that could each run multiple OSs, results confirmed that OS can significantly impact the energy consumption of devices. In particular, the new versions of the Microsoft Windows OS were tested and highlighted significant differences between the OS versions on the same hardware. The developed methodology could enable a greater awareness of energy consumption, during both the software development and software marketing processes.},

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Reusability is a quality desired attribute in software products. Generally, it could be achieved through adopting development methods that promote it and achieving software qualities that have been linked with high reusability proneness. With the exponential growth in mobile application development, software reuse became an integral part in a substantial number of projects. Similarly, software reuse has become widely practiced in start-up companies. However, this has led to new emerging problems. Firstly, the reused code does not meet the required quality and secondly, the reuse intentions are dubious. This work aims to propose a framework to support reuse in Object-Oriented (OO) software development. The framework comprises a process that uses a proposed reusability assessment metric and a formal foundation to specify the elements of the reused code and the relationships between them. The framework is empirically evaluated using a wide range of open-source projects and mobile applications. The results are analyzed to help understand the reusability proneness of OO software and the possible means to improve it.},

	doi = {10.1145/3287324.3287439},
	abstract = {Broadening the participation of underrepresented students in computer science fields requires careful design and implementation of culturally responsive curricula and technologies. Culturally Situated Design Tools (CSDTs) address this by engaging students in historic, cultural, and meaningful design projects based on community practices. To date, CSDT research has only been conducted in short interventions outside of CS classrooms. This paper reports on the first semester-long introductory CS course based on CSDTs, which was piloted with 51 high school students during the 2017-2018 school year. The goal of this study was to examine if a culturally responsive computing curriculum could teach computer science principles and improve student engagement. Pre-post tests, field notes, weekly teacher meetings, formative assessments, and teacher and student interviews were analyzed to assess successes and failures during implementation. The results indicate students learned the conceptual material in 6 months rather than in the 9 months previously required by the teacher. Students were also able to apply these concepts afterward when programming in Python, implying knowledge transfer. However, student opinions about culture and computing didnâĂŹt improve, and student engagement was below initial expectations. Thus we explore some of the many challenges: keeping a fully integrated cultural curriculum while satisfying CS standards, maintaining student engagement, and building student agency and self-regulation. We end with a brief description for how we intend to address some of these challenges in the second iteration of this program, scheduled for fall 2018. After which a study is planned to compare this curriculum to others.},

A key challenge is its characterization regarding sustainability requirements and their dependencies since it depends on, and varies with, the type of software system, and changes in operational contexts. [Aims] With the purpose of facilitating the definition of a context- dependent software sustainability model, we introduce nichesourcing as a type of distributed problem-solving paradigm, named crowdsourcing. [Method] First a set of nichesourcing requirements were identified, and an existing nichesourcing methodology, originally used in the cultural heritage domain was analyzed with respect to its applicability in Software Engineering. [Results] As a result, we propose an adapted methodology for nichesourcing the knowledge on sustainability requirements and their dependencies. Strengths and challenges for crowdsourced software engineering are also identified.},

	abstract = {Sustainability in software engineering is a relatively new and fast growing field of research. Green software engineering aims to produce sustainable software products with minimum negative impact on the environment. In order to make greener software products, software practitioners need actionable timely information, to make useful trade-offs between energy efficiency and other quality attributes, like performance, during development. Software analytics could be used to provide this support, as it combines information from different software artifacts and converts it into useful information. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the sub-domains, contribution types, research types, research methods, future research potentials and the role of software analytics in the field of green software engineering in 2015-16. We applied the systematic mapping method and conducted a search for studies in six online databases. Screening of papers was done according to inclusion/exclusion criteria and 50 selected studies were classified after analysis and data extraction. We found that there are many validation studies but hardly any evaluation and experience papers in the domain of green software engineering. Only 11 out of 50 papers in the green software engineering domain used software analytics techniques to foster green software engineering. Our results indicate the need to develop new/improved automated software analytics tools for software practitioners along with metrics explaining the correlation between energy usage and other quality attributes.},

Though there are many commercial video authoring tools available today, video authoring remains as a tedious and extremely time consuming task that often requires trained professional skills. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a novel interactive end-to-end system that enables fast, flexible and personalized video authoring and sharing. The novel system, called LazyMedia, is based on both content analysis techniques and the proposed content-aware two-layer authoring templates: Composition Template and Presentation Template. Moreover, it is designed as an open and extensible framework that can support dynamic update of core components such as content analysis algorithms, editing methods, and the two-layer authoring templates. Furthermore, the two layers of authoring templates separate the video authoring from video presentation. Once authored with LazyMedia, the video contents can be easily and flexibly presented in other forms according to users' preference. LazyMedia provides a semi-automatic video authoring and sharing system that significantly reduces users' efforts in video editing while preserving sufficient flexibility and personalization.},

Web pages on many sites are produced dynamically as structural records based on a HTML template from a background database. To efficiently extract meaningful information including records and data schema from the kind of pages, a new method based on Tag tree template is proposed. Web pages from different Web sites are parsed into Tag trees, and then templates of each site are generated from the trees by using a cost-based tree similarity measure-ment. The exclusive content in each page is then extracted by using the templates to parse the page. Finally, the records in pages and the schema of the records can be extracted from the exclusive content by finding repeating patterns and using some heuristic rules. The extraction experiments on 360 pages from 12 Web sites are performed, and the result shows that the proposed method is an effective way to extract meaningful information.},

To the best of our knowledge, little existing work reported in the literature has systemically investigated the problem of extracting user reviews from forum sites. Besides the variety of web page templates, user-generated reviews raise two new challenges. First, the inconsistency of review contents in terms of both the document object model (DOM) tree and visual appearance impair the similarity between review records; second, the review content in a review record corresponds to complicated subtrees rather than single nodes in the DOM tree. To tackle these challenges, we present WeRE — a system that performs automatic user review extraction by employing sophisticated techniques. The review records are extracted from web pages based on the proposed level-weighted tree similarity algorithm first, and then the review contents in records are extracted exactly by measuring the node consistency. Our experimental results based on 20 forum sites indicate that WeRE can achieve high extraction accuracy.},

	volume = {14},
	doi = {10.1145/2019599.2019606},
	abstract = {Phishing is a plague in cyberspace. Typically, phish detection methods either use human-verified URL blacklists or exploit Web page features via machine learning techniques. However, the former is frail in terms of new phish, and the latter suffers from the scarcity of effective features and the high false positive rate (FP). To alleviate those problems, we propose a layered anti-phishing solution that aims at (1) exploiting the expressiveness of a rich set of features with machine learning to achieve a high true positive rate (TP) on novel phish, and (2) limiting the FP to a low level via filtering algorithms. Specifically, we proposed CANTINA+, the most comprehensive feature-based approach in the literature including eight novel features, which exploits the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), search engines and third party services with machine learning techniques to detect phish. Moreover, we designed two filters to help reduce FP and achieve runtime speedup. The first is a near-duplicate phish detector that uses hashing to catch highly similar phish. The second is a login form filter, which directly classifies Web pages with no identified login form as legitimate. We extensively evaluated CANTINA+ with two methods on a diverse spectrum of corpora with 8118 phish and 4883 legitimate Web pages. In the randomized evaluation, CANTINA+ achieved over 92\% TP on unique testing phish and over 99\% TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 0.4\% FP with 10\% training phish. In the time-based evaluation, CANTINA+ also achieved over 92\% TP on unique testing phish, over 99\% TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 1.4\% FP under 20\% training phish with a two-week sliding window. Capable of achieving 0.4\% FP and over 92\% TP, our CANTINA+ has been demonstrated to be a competitive anti-phishing solution. ACM Reference Format: Xiang, G., Hong, J., Rose, C.

	abstract = {Automatically identifying and extracting the tar-get information of a webpage, especially main text, is a critical task in many web content analysis applications, such as information retrieval and automated screen reading. However, compared with typical plain texts, the structures of information on the web are extremely complex and have no single fixed template or layout. On the other hand, the amount of presentation elements on web pages, such as dynamic navigational menus, flashing logos, and a multi-tude of ad blocks, has increased rapidly in the past decade. In this paper, we have proposed a statistics-based approach that integrates the concept of fuzzy association rules (FAR) with that of sliding window (SW) to efficiently extract the main text content from web pages. Our approach involves two separate stages. In Stage 1, the original HTML source is pre-processed and features are extracted for every line of text; then, a supervised learning is performed to detect fuzzy association rules in training web pages. In Stage 2, neces-sary HTML source preprocessing and text line feature ex-traction are conducted the same way as that of Stage 1, after which each text line is tested whether it belongs to the main text by extracted fuzzy association rules. Next, a sliding window is applied to segment the web page into several potential topical blocks. Finally, a simple selection algo-rithm is utilized to select those important blocks that are then united as the detected topical region (main texts). Experimental results on real world data show that the effi-ciency and accuracy of our approach are better than existing Document Object Model (DOM)-based and Vision-based approaches.},

As they are increasingly used for critical services, web applications have become a popular and valuable target for security attacks. Although a large body of techniques have been developed to fortify web applications and mitigate attacks launched against them, there has been little effort devoted to drawing connections among these techniques and building the big picture of web application security research. This article surveys the area of securing web applications from the server side, with the aim of sys-tematizing the existing techniques into a big picture that promotes future research. We first present the unique aspects of the web application development that cause inherent challenges in building secure web applications. We then discuss three commonly seen security vulnerabilities within web applications: input validation vulnerabilities, session management vulnerabilities, and application logic vulnerabilities, along with attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities. We organize the existing techniques along two dimensions: (1) the security vulnerabilities and attacks that they address and (2) the design objective and the phases of a web application during which they can be carried out. These phases are secure construction of new web applications, security analysis/testing of legacy web applications, and runtime protection of legacy web applications. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned and discuss future research opportunities in this area.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11432-015-5285-y},
	abstract = {For security, most web applications are developed in some type-safe language, such as JavaScript or Java. However, there is a huge amount of legacy codes developed in unsafe languages, which provide rich functionality and are more efficient than their type-safe counterparts. To allow browsers to incorporate type-safe components in a secure way, previous approaches use the software-based fault isolation (SFI) to isolate untrusted legacy code. The SFI approach performs machine-code transformation for security, but the downside is the loss of architecture independence. We propose WebC, a system that allows legacy code transmitted over the web via the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) bitcode format. The untrusted bitcode is transformed by WebC into code in the WebC security language, which enforces both memory isolation and control-flow integrity. Compared with previous approaches, WebC is more portable, provides stronger security, and allows more flexible memory management. Experimental results show that the average runtime overhead of WebC is modest.},

	volume = {53},
	doi = {10.1016/j.infsof.2010.12.007},
	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Context: Automated static analysis (ASA) identifies potential source code anomalies early in the software development lifecycle that could lead to field failures. Excessive alert generation and a large proportion of unimportant or incorrect alerts (unactionable alerts) may cause developers to reject the use of ASA. Tech-niques that identify anomalies important enough for developers to fix (actionable alerts) may increase the usefulness of ASA in practice. Objective: The goal of this work is to synthesize available research results to inform evidence-based selection of actionable alert identification techniques (AAIT). Method: Relevant studies about AAITs were gathered via a systematic literature review. Results: We selected 21 peer-reviewed studies of AAITs. The techniques use alert type selection; contex-tual information; data fusion; graph theory; machine learning; mathematical and statistical models; or dynamic detection to classify and prioritize actionable alerts. All of the AAITs are evaluated via an exam-ple with a variety of evaluation metrics. Conclusion: The selected studies support (with varying strength), the premise that the effective use of ASA is improved by supplementing ASA with an AAIT. Seven of the 21 selected studies reported the pre-cision of the proposed AAITs. The two studies with the highest precision built models using the subject program's history. Precision measures how well a technique identifies true actionable alerts out of all predicted actionable alerts. Precision does not measure the number of actionable alerts missed by an AAIT or how well an AAIT identifies unactionable alerts. Inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, subject programs, and ASAs in the selected studies preclude meta-analysis and prevent the current results from informing evidence-based selection of an AAIT. We propose building on an actionable alert identification benchmark for comparison and evaluation of AAIT from literature on a standard set of subjects and uti-lizing a common set of evaluation metrics.},

	abstract = {Scientific research addressing the relation between software and sustainability is slowly maturing in two focus areas, related to 'sus-tainable software' and 'software for sustainability'. The first is better understood and may include research foci like energy efficient software and software maintainability. It most-frequently covers 'technical' concerns. The second, 'software for sustainability', is much broader in both scope and potential impact, as it entails how software can contribute to sustainability goals in any sector or application domain. Next to the technical concerns, it may also cover economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Differently from researchers, practitioners are often not aware or well-trained in all four types of software sustainability concerns. To address this need, in previous work we have defined the Sustainability-Quality Assessment Framework (SAF) and assessed its viability via the analysis of a series of software projects. Nevertheless, it was never used by practitioners themselves, hence triggering the question: What can we learn from the use of SAF in practice? To answer this question, we report the results of practitioners applying the SAF to four industrial cases. The results show that the SAF helps practitioners in (1) creating a sustainability mindset in their practices, (2) uncovering the relevant sustainability-quality concerns for the software project at hand, and (3) reasoning about the inter-dependencies and trade-offs of such concerns as well as the related short-and long-term implications. Next to improvements for the SAF, the main lesson for us as researchers is the missing explicit link between the SAF and the (technical) architecture design.},

In this context, while usability is crucial in the development of successful websites, many barely consider the recommendations of experts in order to build usable designs. Including the measurement of usability as part of the development process stands out among these recommendations. One of the most accepted methods for usability evaluation by experts is heuristic evaluation. There is abundant literature on this method. However, there is a lack of clear and specific guidelines to be used in the development and evaluation process. This is probably an important factor contributing to the aforementioned generalized deficiency in web usability. We miss an evaluation method based on heuristics whose measure is adapted to the type of evaluated website. In this paper we define Sirius, an evaluation framework based on heuristics to perform expert evaluations that takes into account different types of websites. We also provide a specific set of evaluation criteria, and a usability metric that quantifies the usability level achieved by a website depending on its type.},

	abstract = {This paper describes how SHARE (Sharing Hosted Autonomous Research Environments) satisfies the criteria of the Elsevier 2011 Executable Paper Grand Challenge. This challenge aims at disseminating the use of systems that provide reviewers and fellow scientists a convenient way to reproduce computational results of research papers. This can involve among others the calculation of a number, the plotting of a diagram, the automatic proof of a theorem or the interactive transformation of various inputs into a complex output document. Besides reproducing the literate results, readers of an executable paper should also be able to explore the result space by entering different input parameters than the ones reported in the original text. SHARE is a web portal that enables academics to create, share, and access remote virtual machines that can be cited from research papers. By deploying in SHARE a copy of the required operating system as well as all the relevant software and data, authors can make a conventional paper fully reproducible and interactive. Shared virtual machines can also contain the original paper text — when desirable even with embedded computations. This paper shows the concrete potential of SHARE-based articles by means of an example virtual machine that is based on a conventional research article published by Elsevier recently. More generally, it demonstrates how SHARE has supported the publication workflow of a journal special issue and various workshop proceedings. Finally, it clarifies how the SHARE architecture supports among others the Elsevier challenge's licensing and scalability requirements without domain specific restrictions.},

Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source software and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities, but improving the sharing of research software has not yet been a strong focus of the latter. To improve the FAIRness of research software, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has sought to understand how to apply the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship to research software, bringing together existing and new community efforts. Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles.

Not only do they compro-mise the relevance judgment of many web IR and web min-ing methods such as clustering and classification, but they also negatively impact the performance and resource usage of tools that process web pages. In this paper we present a new method that efficiently and accurately removes tem-plates found in collections of web pages. Our method works in two steps. First,the costly process of template detection is performed over a small set of sample pages. Then, the derived template is removed from the remaining pages in the collection. This leads to substantial performance gains when compared to previous approaches that combine tem-plate detection and removal. We show, through an exper-imental evaluation, that our approach is effective for iden-tifying terms occurring in templates—obtaining F-measure values around 0.9, and that it also boosts the accuracy of web page clustering and classification methods.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t A novel methodology for modeling the reliability and performance of web services (WSs) is presented. To present the methodology, an experimental environment is developed in house, where WSs are treated as atomic entities but the underlying middleware is partitioned into layers. WSs are deployed in JBoss AS. Web service requests are generated to a remote middleware on which JBoss runs, and important performance parameters under various configurations are collected. In addition, a modularized simu-lation model in Petri net is developed from the architecture of the middleware and run-time behavior of the WSs. The results show that (1) the simulation model provides for measuring the performance and reliability of WSs under different loads and conditions that may be of great interest to WS design-ers and the professionals involved; (2) configuration parameters have substantial impact on the overall performance; (3) the simulation model provides a basis for aggregating the modules (layers), nullifying modules, or to include additional aspects of the WS architecture; and (4) the model is beneficial to predict the performance of WSs for those cases that are difficult to replicate in a field study.},

Objective: We propose a model aimed at supporting researchers to transfer knowledge to SE practice. Method: This model is built upon the foundation of Rapid Reviews and Evidence Briefings. These two key elements have been proven effective in other domains, such as medicine, and initial results suggest that they can play a prominent role in SE as well. Results: We discuss how to apply the model as well as possible challenges that might hinder its adoption. Conclusion: We believe that both SE practitioners and researchers could benefit from the proposed model. We expect replications and instantiations of the model in the future.},

	abstract = {Integrating novel software systems in our society, economy and environment can have far-reaching efects. As a result, software systems should be designed in such a way as to maintain or improve the sustainability of their intended socio-technical systems. However, a paradigm shift is required to raise awareness of software professionals on the potential sustainability efects of software systems. While Requirements Engineering is considered the key for driving this change, requirements engineers lack the knowledge, experience and methodological support for acting as facilitators for a broader discussion on sustainability efects. This paper presents a question-based framework for raising awareness of the potential efects of software systems on sustainability, as the frst step towards enabling the required paradigm shift. An evaluation study of the framework was conducted with four groups of computer science students. The results of the study indicate that the framework is applicable to diferent types of systems and helps to facilitate discussions about the potential efects that software systems could have on sustainability.},

	abstract = {Software engineers are plagued by the same troubles as many others in highly skilled jobs and digitized environments: Ever-expanding to-do lists, time to market pressure from management, deadline-driven development, continuous interruption during working tasks, and the juggle of balancing that with other areas of life (physical, mental and emotional health, family, household, finance, friends, hobbies and community service). These demands of life in combination with a seemingly ever-increasing pace wear or burn out many people in the long run. Specifically, as software engineers, this also leads to decreased creativity and less efficiency in problem-solving. Generally offered solutions are reducing screen time and spending more time outdoors, both of which are hard to do within the work of a software engineer. On a meta level, if the developers of the systems that run most of our world do not develop individual sustainability with a balanced pace of life, that imbalance propagates into the systems we develop (similar to Conway's Law). We argue that mindfulness practices like yoga poses (asanas), breathing practices , and meditation exercises can help individually, and even more effectively in combination. In this exploratory paper, we discuss related work that explores the application of these mitigations in other application domains and propose a research agenda to explore their use within software engineering education and practice. Engaging with mindfulness practices in the context of software engineering promises to enhance creativity and cognitive problem-solving skills, leading to more efficiency and effectiveness during software development and increased individual sustainability. This, in turn, leads to better team spirit as well as increased economic profit, both in terms of maintaining human capital and customer contract deliverables.},

In Test Driven Development (TDD), first come tests and then the code. The minimal piece of code is written in order to pass the designed test. In other words, it is the process of testing the code before its accrual writing. If the code passes the test, then developers can proceed to its refactoring. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a customer-focused process. It is based on the full and clear understanding of the system or module behavior but in the terms of business/client. The tests for TDD are created by developers for developers. The test for BDD can be written by testers or technical managers. Acceptance TestDriven Development (ATDD) is towards the developer-focused side of things. ATDD is a technique where the entire team collaborates to define the acceptance criteria of a story before the implementation actually begins. These acceptance tests are supported necessary information. Using the Given-When-Then format, ATDD approach can implement.},

	abstract = {Electronic bulletin boards have become more popular with the advent of low cost computers, easily available communication channels, and large network systems. With its public posting of messages, relatively large audiences can read and provide immediate feedback. Network organization provides a hierarchical system to give users access to thousands with like interests across the country, or even the world. A random sample of bulletin board users was selected from the two major national bulletin board services, CompuServe® and Prodigy®, and interviewed asynchronously, on-line, using electronic mail. This study characterized this bulletin board audience focusing on the issues of 1) adoption-- what characteristics bulletin board users possess, and 2) social impacts-- how bulletin board adoption affects the use of other communication media. Results of the on-line survey supported adoption hypotheses suggesting bulletin board users are higher educated, more wealthy, and work in more prestigious occupations the average American. Rejected was a similar lower age hypothesis. Open-ended responses to the question "why use boards?" were content analyzed, with selections made to categories in five areas showing a typology of use for this medium. Hypotheses suggesting a reduction of consumption of the media television, books, telephone use, and personal letter writing were supported. Rejected were suggestions of lower magazine reading, face-to-face conversations, and other online communication. The findings also showed significant differences in the CompuServe and Prodigy systems along several of the above variables, in addition to quantity of use, message rate, and family usage patterns.},

Unfortunately then, previous research has shown that unit tests do not always co-evolve nicely with the production code, thus leaving the software vulnerable. This paper presents TestNForce, a tool that helps developers to identify the unit tests that need to be altered and executed after a code change, thereby reducing the effort needed to keep the unit tests in sync with the changes to the production code. In order to evaluate TestNForce, we perform a user study that evaluates the adequacy, usefulness and completeness of TestNForce .},

We study the nature, evolution, and prevalence of these templates on the web. As part of this work, we develop new randomized algorithms for template extraction that perform approximately twenty times faster than existing approaches with similar quality. Our results show that 40--50\% of the content on the web is template content. Over the last eight years, the fraction of template content has doubled, and the growth shows no sign of abating. Text, links, and total HTML bytes within templates are all growing as a fraction of total content at a rate of between 6 and 8\% per year. We discuss the deleterious implications of this growth for information retrieval and ranking, classification, and link analysis.},

However, there is currently no agreed definition of the concept. Current definitions range from a composite, non-functional requirement to simply an emergent property. This lack of clarity leads to confusion, and potentially to ineffective and inefficient efforts to develop sustainable software systems. The aim of this paper is to explore the emerging definitions of software sustainability from the field of software engineering in order to contribute to the question, what is software sustainability? The preliminary analysis suggests that the concept of software sustainability is complex and multifaceted with any consensus towards a shared definition within the field of software engineering yet to be achieved.},

The Now Web perspective means that only very recent states of the Web are being observed through browsers or through the crawling and index structures of search engines. Such a view ignores the utility of historical data to system designers and end-users alike. This dissertation characterizes content and behavior within the Dynamic Web. This work further illustrates the power of Dynamic Web data by utilizing measures of content change and behavioral measures of use to identify likely targets of user revisitation on the page level. Additionally, two systems are offered for manipulating temporal Web data • DTWExplorer, a tool for analyzing time-series representations of content and behavior to identify correlations in different types of temporal Web data. • Zoetrope, an end-user tool for querying, aggregating, and visualizing historical Web data from the context of the Now Web. This work capitalizes on the richness of the Dynamic Web and demonstrates how moving away from temporally insensitive models and tools can enhance existing applications (e.g., crawlers and search engines) and lead to novel applications and systems.},

Two sections with a total of 69 students served as participants of the study. The grades of the teacher in the course, oral defense grades, panel members' individual ratings on the students, and self-assessment rating using rubrics were collected by the researchers. Paired sample t-test was employed to determine if self-assessment ratings were significantly different from the teacher's grade, oral defense grade, and panel members' individual ratings on the students. Moreover, self-rating assessment was investigated between low and high performing students. Informal interviews with five students were conducted to explain their self-assessment ratings. All rejected are the three null hypotheses stating that self-rating assessments are not significantly different from the teacher's grade, oral defense grade, and panel members' individual ratings on the students. Meanwhile, the fourth null hypothesis stating that there is no significant difference between the self-assessment rating of the low-performing and high-performing students in the research writing course was accepted. Thus, the statistical analyses revealed that students tend to inflate the self-assessment rating in order to achieve higher grades regardless of their classroom performance. The study described the utilization of selfassessment rubrics of computer science students enrolled in a research writing class. Recommendations and limitations were also discussed.},

	title = {Modelling and {Assessing} the {Environmental} {Impacts} of {Software}},
	abstract = {Software is used on billions of devices every day for numerous activities and services that the modern world relies upon. It also has the potential to control energy consumption and maximise device efficiency, thus minimising device and service environmental impact. The academic background to the environmental impact of software, at the beginning of this research, was minor and little utilised by information and communications technology (ICT) organisations. Consequently, this research analysed and modelled three main software types enabling the environmental analysis of software use to take place with real data and information. Firstly, Operating Systems (OS) and their power management features were analysed. OS form the foundation of any software based activity and control device componentry, and thus overall device energy consumption. The overall impact of an OS, not just a devices idle or maximum power, was investigated with a new set of measurements, methods, and models constructed in this research. Secondly, new methodologies to measure the energy consumption of electronic software distribution (ESD) and cloud computing were created, which spanned the entire life cycle of the data route. Both technologies were modelled and measured across a number of real scenarios. ESD and cloud computing can be utilised to dematerialise and increase the efficiency of some high energy impact activities. Additionally, it was found that cloud computing can be utilised to reduce the impact of data and process intensive computing, but can also be wasteful compared to traditional computing when utilised for certain types of low resource software activities. Finally, a novel framework was created to enable the analysis and comparison of the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the same software activity across a range of devices and OS, according to the technical functionality and price of a set of devices. This framework enables the analysis of devices according to their software GHG emission efficiencies across different platforms and may allow manufacturers and consumers to maximise and drive forward environmental awareness. In conclusion, this research has set the foundations for quantifying, and has demonstrated, the large potential that software has to reduce energy consumption and overall environmental impact.},

Specifically, the impact of code smell refactoring on energy efficiency has been scarcely investigated. In the exploratory study here reported, we investigate the impact on performance and energy consumption of refactoring well-known code smells on Java software applications. In order to understand if software metrics can be used as indicators of the energy impact of refactoring, we also measured the variation caused by refactoring on a set of well-established software metrics. We conducted a controlled experiment using state-of-the-art power measurement equipment. Statistical hypothesis testing and effect size estimation were performed on the experimental results, which show that in one out of three applications, refactoring each smell significantly impacted power-and energy consumption. E.g., refactoring Feature Envy and Long Method smells led to a 49\% energy efficiency improvement. No software metric, however, significantly correlated with execution time, power or energy consumption. In conclusion, refactoring code smells resulted to be a viable process to significantly improve software energy efficiency. The magnitude of the impact may depend on application properties, e.g. size or age. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between software metrics and energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Software energy consumption is a relatively new concern for mobile application developers. Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy consumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application. In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10\% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, transmit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run. Our model is based on the dynamic traces of system calls and CPU utilization.},

	abstract = {Background: Supporting sustainability in software engineering is becoming an active area of research and we want to contribute the first SLR in this field. Researchers who are motivated to contribute to that topic need to accumulate a body of knowledge as starting point through time-consuming literature research. Aim: We aim to provide an overview of different aspects of sustainability in software engineer- ing research with regard to research activity, investigated topics, identified limitations, proposed approaches, used methods, available studies, and considered domains. Method: The applied method is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in five reliable and commonly-used databases according to the (quasi-standard) protocol by Kitchenham et al. [288]. We assessed the 100 first results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classified publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unfitting usage of terms within the search query. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Conclusions: Currently, there is little research coverage on the different aspects of sustainability in software engineering. Future work includes extending the study by reviewing a higher number of publications, including dedicated journal and workshop searches, and snowballing.},

Researches have proposed approaches for energy management, ranging from reducing usage of software and hardware, compilators optimization, to server consolidation and software migration. However, optimizing the energy consumption requires knowledge of that said consumption. In particular, measuring the energy consumption of hardware and software is an important requirement for efficient energy strategies. In this review, we outline the different categories of approaches in energy measurements, and provide insights into example of each category. We draw recommendations from our review on requirements on how to efficiently measure energy consumption of devices and software.},

	abstract = {As ICT impacts dramatically on the sustainability of the world and of individuals, both positive and negative, there is an urgent need to educate Computer Science students about Sustainability. This paper assesses the experience of a project to introduce new University students in a Computer Science department to concepts of sustainability. It describes the team project approach used during the first few weeks of a student's time at the University of the West of England and the standard template for sustainable technology proposals. It reviews the learning from five years of the programme and engagement of over 250 students. The programme has received positive student feedback and broadened the sustainability awareness of students. It has become an opportunity to introduce all new students in the department to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The programme has shown reduced levels of student engagement in recent years and the paper explores some of the reasons for this. Overall, the programme makes a positive contribution to achievement of the University's sustainability policy and supports the requirements of the relevant professional body and the UK Quality Assurance Agency.)},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystems have reshaped the ways how software-intensive firms develop products and deliver value to customers. However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture com-moditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was itera-tively developed in close collaboration with the firm's practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Today's software systems are more frequently composed from preexisting commercial or non-commercial components and connectors. These components provide complex and independent functionality and are engaged in complex interactions. Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is concerned with composing, selecting and designing such components. As the popularity of this approach and hence number of commercially available software components grows, selecting a set of components to satisfy a set of requirements while minimizing cost is becoming more difficult. This problem necessitates the design of efficient algorithms to automate component selection for software developing organizations. We address this challenge through analysis of Component Selection, the NP-complete process of selecting a minimal cost set of components to satisfy a set of objectives. Due to the high order of computational complexity of this problem, we examine approximating solutions that make the component selection process practicable. We adapt a greedy approach and a genetic algorithm to approximate this problem. We examined the performance of studied algorithms on a set of selected ActiveX components. Comparing the results of these two algorithms with the choices made by a group of human experts shows that we obtain better results using these approximation algorithms.},

When demand surpasses capacity, it's time to buy add-on memory. When the system has no more extensibility, it's time to buy a new, more powerful workstation. Do increased performance and functionality keep pace with the increased demand for resources? Mostly the answer is no. The author contends that software's girth has surpassed its functionality, largely because hardware advances make this possible. He maintains that the way to streamline software lies in disciplined methodologies and a return to the essentials. He explores the reasons behind software's increasing heft and relates the history of Project Oberon as an example of how software should be built. Oberon's primary goal was to show that software can be developed with a fraction of the memory capacity and processor power usually required without sacrificing flexibility, functionality, or user convenience. The Oberon system has been in use since 1989, serving purposes that include document preparation, software development, and computer-aided design of electronic circuits, among many others. The system includes storage management, a file system, a window display manager, a network with servers, a compiler, and text, graphics, and document editors.},

	abstract = {Software engineers make decisions about the design of the software they are creating on a daily basis. These decisions may impact the application in terms of efficiency, usability, flexibility, etc. Different competing design decisions are therefore often evaluated in terms of their projected impact on quality metrics prior to implementation. Recently energy has become a concern for software systems, ranging from mobile devices to large data centers. Additionally, it has been recognized that the software executing on a computing device can have a significant impact on the device's energy consumption. This raises the obvious question of whether or not it is possible to reduce the energy consumption of a software system by the means of software design decisions. This work examines how the use of different servers impacts the energy consumption of a web application. Through a controlled empirical experiment we have discovered several important findings in this regard. The results indicate that the energy consumption of a web application can vary greatly depending on the web server used to handle its requests. Furthermore, different web servers are more or less energy efficient depending on which web application features are being executed. The paper details an analysis of the results of the experiment. © 2013 IEEE.},

These Green IT initiatives aim to reduce energy-loss in the supply chain from energy grid to computing devices. However, the demand for computation comes from software applications that perform business services. Therefore, to measure and im- prove efficiency for entire systems, energy-efficiency indicators are needed at the level of services. We have designed an initial set of indicators for energy- efficiency of e-services and we have tested them on two e- government services of the Dutch national government. We explain how these indicators serve as a starting point for energy- optimization initiatives, supported by appropriate contractual agreements between service owners and suppliers.},

This paper regards creativity as a path to developing sustainability, and it particularly considers creativity as a scientific literacy that indicates a collection of awareness, ability, and skills about sustainability. Following this point, in software engineering education, creativity should be a necessary element, as software engineers are key actors in designing, researching, and developing products of social media that are most important ways of enhancing public awareness of sustainability. Therefore, this paper will further discuss some potential pedagogy strategies by which creativity and sustainability can be developed among young software engineers.},

	title = {How {Should} {Software} {Engineering} {Secondary} {Studies} {Include} {Grey} {Material}?},
	abstract = {Recent papers have proposed the use of grey literature (GL) and multivocal reviews. These papers have raised issues about the practices used for systematic reviews (SRs) in software engineering (SE) and suggested that there should be changes to the current SR guidelines. Objective: To investigate whether current SR guidelines need to be changed to support GL and multivocal reviews. Method: We discuss the definitions of GL and the importance of GL and of industry-based field studies in SE SRs. We identify properties of SRs that constrain the material used in SRs: a) the nature of primary studies; b) the requirements of SRs to be auditable, traceable, and reproducible; and explain why these requirements restrict the use of blogs in SRs. Results: SR guidelines have always considered GL as a possible source of primary studies and have never supported exclusion of field studies that incorporate the practitioners’ viewpoint. However, the concept of GL, which was meant to refer to documents that were not formally published, is now being extended to information from sources such as blogs/tweets/Q\&A posts. Thus, it might seem that SRs do not make full use of GL because they do not include such information. However, the unit of analysis for an SR is the primary study. Thus, it is not the source but the type of information that is important. Any report describing a rigorous empirical evaluation is a candidate primary study. Whether it is actually included in an SR depends on the SR eligibility criteria. However, any study that cannot be guaranteed to be publicly available in the long term should not be used as a primary study in an SR. This does not prevent such information from being aggregated in surveys of social media and used in the context of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE). Conclusions: Current guidelines for SRs do not require extensions, but their scope needs to be better defined. SE researchers require guidelines for analysing social media posts (e.g., blogs, tweets, vlogs), but these should be based on qualitative primary (not secondary) study guidelines. SE researchers can use mixed-methods SRs and/or the fourth step of EBSE to incorporate findings from social media surveys with those from SRs and to develop industry-relevant recommendations.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing pervasiveness of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) not only is determining radical changes in everyone’s life-style, in the social organizations, and in the economic dynamics, but it is causing relevant direct and indirect effects on the environment as well. One of the aspects not yet sufficiently addressed in literature is the sustainability of the software lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on the sustainability management of software development projects. In the practice, software development projects are managed by considering principally parameters as time, costs and quality of work products. We propose a methodological approach aimed at identifying sustainability indicators to be used in project management to set up sustainability objectives for a software development project, to control their achievement during the project itself and, possibly, to adopt corrective actions to maintain the project aligned with them. The availability of such sustainability indicators may contribute to reduce the carbon footprint of the activities performed in software development projects as well as to speed-up the development of a green culture in organizations developing software.},

As a matter of fact, cloud users require that the service level they are paying for is tightly met, whereas data center owners try to cut down their operational expenses. In this paper, we propose a novel consolidation algorithm that exploits emerging software development paradigms. Our approach enables cloud users to indicate their willingness to apply energy saving mechanisms to some of their virtual resources, hence giving infrastructure managers the ability to apply more efficient workload consolidation and to switch their hardware to very low-power states. The result is an optimal trade-off between energy consumption and performance.},

	abstract = {Digitally enabled technologies are increasingly cyber-physical systems (CPSs). They are networked in nature and made up of geographically dispersed components that manage and control data received from humans, equipment, and the environment. Researchers evaluating such technologies are thus challenged to include CPS subsystems and dynamics that might not be obvious components of a product system. Although analysts might assume CPS have negligible or purely beneficial impact on environmental outcomes, such assumptions require justification. As the physical environmental impacts of digital processes (e.g. cryptocurrency mining) gain attention, the need for explicit attention to CPS in environmental assessment becomes more salient. This review investigates how the peer-reviewed environmental assessment literature treats environmental implications of CPS, with a focus on journal articles published in English between 2010 and 2020. We identify nine CPS subsystems and dynamics addressed in this literature: energy system, digital equipment, non-digital equipment, automation and management, network infrastructure, direct costs, social and health effects, feedbacks, and cybersecurity. Based on these categories, we develop a ‘cyber-consciousness score’ reflecting the extent to which the 115 studies that met our evaluation criteria address CPS, then summarize analytical methods and modeling techniques drawn from reviewed literature to facilitate routine inclusion of CPS in environmental assessment. We find that, given challenges in establishing system boundaries, limited standardization of how to evaluate CPS dynamics, and failure to recognize the role of CPS in a product system under evaluation, the extant environmental assessment literature in peer-reviewed journals largely ignores CPS subsystems and dynamics when evaluating digital or digitally-enabled technologies.},

	title = {The {LEAP} {Technology} {Landscape} {Lower} {Energy} {Acceleration} {Program} ({LEAP}) {Solutions}, {Adoption} {Factors}, {Impediments}, {Open} {Problems}, and {Scenarios}},
	abstract = {This technology landscape is intended for all stakeholders that aim at contributing to building a future-proof energy eï¿¿cient digital infrastructure , from business organizations like data centers, software development companies, telecommunication service providers, to business customers, NGOs and end users; but also governmental organizations, decision makers and funding agencies. With the introduction of high bandwidth data transfers, aï¿¿ordable data plans, the generalized migration to the cloud of software applications and data management, and the popularization of streaming services, digital infrastructures are experiencing an ever-growing demand of data consumption. As expected, the related energy consumption is steadily increasing over time. This motivated sector leaders like Microsoft, Google and Amazon, to increasingly adopt in recent years renewable energy resources, e.g., solar and wind farms, as a means to lower the environmental impact of their hy-perscale data centers. Nevertheless, adopting renewable energy can be considered only as part of the solution, as (i) such adoption does not tackle the need to optimize the use of cloud resources, and (ii) the production of renewable energy will not meet its demands already in the near future. With the global transition toward the adoption of renewable energy resources, the whole society will need them. Therefore, exploiting renewables for the future data infrastructures will not, as such, make them sustainable, but rather they need to become energy eï¿¿cient, too, not to compete with the other industrial sectors. This is especially true when considering the Netherlands, which constitutes a prominent European "data hub" distributed over a relatively small geographic area 1. For the last decades the digital infrastructure industry has been able to maintain a relentless pace of introducing new generations of faster and more energy eï¿¿cient computing hardware approximately every two years. Nevertheless data consumption is rising faster than the improvement in energy eï¿¿ciency and now also the so called "Dennard scaling" [4], that allowed lower power consumption with each new semiconductor generation, is irremediably coming to an end. In addition, with the ever-growing increase of 1 https://www.pbl.nl/publicaties/grote-opgaven-in-een-beperkte-ruimte data transport speeds, the power consumed in wiring and communication is rising more than linearly. To maintain the increase in data processing power, new solutions are needed. In this context, the Lower Energy Acceleration Program 2 (LEAP) was launched to explore alternative solutions towards a sustainable growth of the data center industry. The aim of LEAP is to accelerate the transition to a sustainable digital infrastructure in which we integrate innovative developments at the heart of our energy system and provide a solution for spatial planning with circular use of materials. One of the topics in the LEAP program is the development of a technology landscape for energy eï¿¿cient digital infrastructures. This landscape focuses on three diï¿¿erent temporal horizons, namely: • Horizon 1 (H1): State of the art (today) • Horizon 2 (H2): Within the next 4-6 years (near future) • Horizon 3 (H3): Beyond 6 years (future) In this report, we provide insights into the research conducted by the Software and Sustainability (S2) research group 3 at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam focusing on H2 and the role of software technology for energy eï¿¿cient digital infrastructures; and Photon-Delta focusing on H3 and the role of hardware technology. In this research, we have carried out a series of interviews with various stakeholders of the data center industry, on the future directions that will lead to more energy eï¿¿cient digital infrastructures. The collected results were then reï¿¿ned and validated via focus groups involving additional participants. In total, 45 participants took part to this study. It is important to note that the presented landscape focuses on the energy eï¿¿ciency of digital infrastructures. Hence, other sustainability aspects of digital infrastructures, such as life cycle assessment, carbon footprint, circularity and waste management, etc. fall outside the scope of this landscape. The report is structured as follows. In Section 3 we provide a broad overview of the energy eï¿¿cient digital infrastructure solutions prospected in the 3 horizons. Section 4 presents the key adoption factors of the solutions, while Section 5 presents the most prominent impediments for their adoption. In Section 6, we present open problems regarding energy eï¿¿cient digital infrastructure solutions. Finally, Section 7 sketches the four future scenarios emerging from the study, followed by an outlook to the next steps in Section 8. 2 https://amsterdameconomicboard.com/en/initiatief/leap-lower-energy-acceleration-program 3 https://s2group.cs.vu.nl 1},

Design Science and Action Research were selected for their usage in software engineering. We also chose a model emanating from software engineering, i.e., the Technology Transfer Model. An overview of each methodology is provided. It is followedby a discussion and an illustration concerning their use in industry–academia collaborative research. The three methodologies are then compared using a set of criteria as a basis for our guidance. * Results:The discussion and comparison of the three research methodologies revealed general similarities and distinct differences. All three research methodologies are easily mapped to the general research process describe–solve–practice, while the main driver behind the formulation of the research methodologies is different. Thus, we guide in selecting a research methodology given the primary research objective for a given research study or project in collaboration between industry and academia. * Conclusions:We observe that the three research methodologies have different main objectives and differ insome characteristics, although still having a lot in common. We conclude that it is vital to make an informed decision concerning which research methodology to use.

The goal of this pilot was to test in a live environment how the monitoring of processes on servers in a live datacenter hold up in practice, and to investigate how well the measurements were in comparison to the empirically measured figures. During the pilot phase, a number of problems surfaced that had to do with the fact that the test servers were running outdated software and were really backup servers. This made measurement less useful, because no heavy load baring processes were running on them, however, these servers were suited for analyses, because there were still some interesting processes on it. For comparison, another set of servers was rigged to run a grid computing project in order to generate utilization. Lessons were learned about deployment in live datacenters, data consolidation methods and empirical data. Furthermore the interpretation of what data the datacenter management finds useful.},

We discuss two industrial cases where such Green Software Scans were applied to an e-government and a mobile banking application. Among the lessons drawn from these cases are that significant energy savings can be realized with targeted modifications in software code, architecture, or configuration, that development of energy-efficient applications requires attention to detail throughout the development process, and that a close collaboration between operations and development is one of the main success factors for energy-efficient applications.},

	abstract = {The awareness for software as an important player regarding the energy consumption caused by ICT steadily increased in the past years. The impact of software on the energy consumption is also more and more accepted by the research community under the umbrella of sustainability in general. Nevertheless, the end user is still only slightly or not addressed in the research activities regarding the whole energy consumption of software over its complete lifecycle. Also other stakeholders, e.g. administrators, designers, developers etc., are not in the focus of creating awareness for the aforementioned topics. In this contribution, we therefore focus on ideas, approaches, and challenges in developing a general-purpose labelling process for green and sustainable software products and websites. At first we provide a literature roundup, followed by the elaboration of requirements for the creation of a sustainability label for software products in general based on already existing and new approaches. On a first attempt, we furthermore concentrate on a labelling process for sustainable as well as green websites and sum up with a discussion followed by an outlook on our future work.},

	abstract = {Degradation of the natural environment is presently attracting significant attention among the Information Systems (IS) academic community. Consequently, the subject of sustainability continues to gain a foothold in the mainstream of IS research. However, as the body of research grows, the exact meaning of sustainability is increasingly becoming a source of uncertainty. The absence of a clear definition of sustainability in the IS domain poses a challenge for operationalizing the concept and limits the methodological viability of research in the field. By means of a systematic literature review, this paper identifies problems related to diverging or even a complete absence of sustainability definitions in the relevant IS literature. The results reveal what constitutes a sound definition of sustainability as a characteristic of a stakeholder activity and a new perspective for Information Systems research on sustainability, in which an activity becomes a quantum of sustainability analysis. The paper discusses the broader implications for further research.},

Imagine an end-user who has no power outlet access and must remain productive on the laptop's battery life. How does this user maximize their laptop's battery life, yet remain productive? What does the user have to give up to keep on working? We highlight the perils that users face and the ultimate responsibility users have for the battery life and energy consumption of their mobile devices; using multiple scenarios we show that executing a task can consume more or less energy depending on the requirements and software choices of users. We investigate multiple scenarios demonstrating that applications can consume energy differently for the same task thus illustrating the tradeoffs that end-users can make for the sake of energy consumption.},

In this paper we present the first empir- ical study on understanding the views of application pro- grammers on software energy consumption problems. Using StackOverflow as our primary data source, we analyze a carefully curated sample of more than 300 questions and 550 answers from more than 800 users. With this data, we observed a number of interesting findings. Our study shows that practitioners are aware of the energy consumption prob- lems: the questions they ask are not only diverse – we found 5 main themes of questions – but also often more interest- ing and challenging when compared to the control question set. Even though energy consumption-related questions are popular when considering a number of different popularity measures, the same cannot be said about the quality of their answers. In addition, we observed that some of these an- swers are often flawed or vague. We contrast the advice provided by these answers with the state-of-the-art research on energy consumption. Our summary of software energy consumption problems may help researchers focus on what matters the most to software developers and end users.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development (SD) has become a millennium challenge for humanity. It has boosted the integration of sustainable, sound practices across different fields (e.g. e-participation, smart transportation, sustainable agriculture). Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have strongly supported social transitions in becoming more sustainable and participative over the last two decades. Integrating multi-disciplinary sustainability concepts into the higher education of computer scientists is important in that this ensures that future ICT endeavours will take sustainability concerns into account. This article describes four capstone projects developed by students from the Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Pervasive Computing and Communications for Sustainable Development (PERCCOM), who were enrolled alongside regular students in a traditional software engineering course held at the Lappeenranta University of Technology. The coursework was part of a research project called Green.Citizen@ICT, which aims at investigating the use of ICT and software services for infusing sustainable habits in citizens through the development of applications for SD. This study demonstrates how a sustainable development focus can be integrated into a traditional software engineering course. The goal of this article is to enhance understanding of the integration of sustainability into software engineering education, by providing a detailed example of a master course in which this took place. This course supported the development of ICT competences for building cleaner, greener, and more resource- and energy-efficient cyber-physical systems, while addressing the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.},

It investigates the sustainability dimensions in the course curriculum of computer sciences (CS), information technology (IT) and software engineering (SE). The survey among CS, IT and SE students at the Saudi university in the western and southern regions of the kingdom is conducted in order to investigate their awareness regarding sustainable development. A total of 318 related students from various public sector universities in the western and southern regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) contributed by surveys of their awareness towards sustainable development. The results indicates that 71\% of them are unaware of the term of sustainable development, only 17\% of them know the basic definition of sustainable development, and 12\% of them have an idea of how sustainable development is related to the software development. Furthermore, It indicates that the current curriculum does not sufficiently cover specific subjects about sustainable development. As a results, the educational institutes and universities have to provide sustainability awareness and understanding among the students and thus they have to develop their vision, policy, teaching strategies, research objectives, and curriculum.},

While a signi ficant body of research exists to measure, monitor, and control the greenness level of hardware components, significant research efforts are needed to relate hardware energy consumption to energy consumption due to program execution. In this paper we report on our investigations to characterize power consumption profiles for different types of compute and memory intensive software applications. In particular, we focus on studying the effects of CPU loads on the power consumption of compute servers by monitoring rack power consumption in a data center. We conducted a series of experiments with a variety of processes of different complexity to understand and characterize the effect on power consumption. Combining processes of varying complexity with varying resource allocations produces different energy consumption levels. The challenge is to optimize process orchestration based on a power consumption framework to accrue energy savings. Our ultimate goal is to develop smart adaptive green computing techniques, such as adaptive job scheduling and resource provisioning, to reduce overall power consumption in data centers or clouds.},

Web services are an important part of data centers' workload, and a large contributor to their energy footprint. This paper contributes an approach that, leveraging statistical data over web services usage patterns, dynamically predicts the resources required by the web service application. Our framework, SOPRA, uses these predictions to constantly adapt the allocation of resources to minimize the energy utilization of the data center. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by executing SOPRA over a synthetic workload. We compare the energy savings achieved by SOPRA with the traditional over allocation strategy and with the saving achievable by using a static predictor. Furthermore, we show how different service level agreements (SLA) influence the ability to save energy. The results of our experiments show that, with our workload, we can save up to 52.49\% of energy over the over-allocation approach while a static prediction can only achieve a 44.78\% saving. Moreover, our results show that the SLA has a high impact on energy savings. Using a more demanding SLA, the energy saving SOPRA was able to achieve was only 28.29\%. © 2013 IEEE.},

The goal is to reveal how a set of independent variables (factors) influences one or more dependent variables. With a vast number of factors or a high amount of factors' values (levels), this process becomes time-and energy-consuming. Current approaches to lower the benchmarking effort suffer from two deficiencies: (1) they focus on reducing the number of factors and, hence, are inapplicable to experiments with only two factors, but a vast number of levels and (2) being adopted from, e.g., combinatorial optimization they are designed for a different search space structure and, thus, can be very wasteful. This paper provides an approach for benchmark reduction, based on adaptive instance selection and multiple linear regression. We evaluate our approach using four empirical studies, which investigate the effect made by dynamic voltage and frequency scaling in combination with dynamic concurrency throttling on the energy consumption of a computing system (parallel compression, sorting, and encryp-tion algorithms as well as database query processing). Our findings show the effectiveness of the approach. We can save 78\% of bench-marking effort, while the result's quality decreases only by 3 pp, due to using only a near-optimal configuration.},

	abstract = {Current software engineering practices have significant effects on the environment. Examples include e-waste from computers made discarded due to software upgrades, and changes in the power demands of new versions of software. Sustainable softwareengineering aims to create reliable, long-lasting software that satisfy the needs of users while reducing environmental impacts. Sustainability is becoming a significant emerging area in Information Technology (IT)—as contribution of IT to safeguard our future, and as evolving market segment. IT’s high productivity in combination with short life cycles and, on the other hand, growing resource problems of our planet, lead to a essence that software engineers take their share of responsibility for sustainability. Therefore, we need to include the concept of sustainability into the university curriculum of computer science, software engineering and information systems. According to the World Commission on Environment and Development Sustainability, sustainability is defined as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. The goal with sustainable software engineering is to create better software so future generations’ opportunities should not be compromised. According to the SMART 2020 report, in 2007 the ICT sector was responsible for 2\% of global carbon emissions. Additionally, the report estimates that the combined carbon footprint of PCs and monitors is expected to triple by 2020. While there is growing interest among software engineers regarding environmental sustainability, the relationship between software and sustainability is still a relatively minor concern, if it is thought of at all, for most users and developers. Our goal with this research is to raise awareness that similar software systems can have quite different levels of energy consumption, and therefore different environmental footprints, and that these and other environmental impacts are an important part of the software engineering field. Sustainability, software engineering and green computing study in computing is not only critical and imminent for the long-term benefit of human beings, but also has the potential to attract more students to this area due to its indispensable significance for future. Over the past few years, sustainable software engineering and green computing has received an increasing amountof attention since it is considered as one of the critical factors for protecting the environment. The challenge is to motivate and interest students and faculty members for sustainability, to identify spheres of activity for software engineers, to build up competence fields for solutions, and to incorporate the topic into the curriculum.},

The consumption of electrical energy generates at the end carbon emissions known also as carbon footprints. The eco-friendly cloud computing purpose is to decrease the carbon footprint of data centers by reducing their energy consumption. A considerable research has been performed with the purpose of supporting the eco-friendly cloud vision by optimizing the usage of computing resources from all areas of interest: software, hardware, network and storage. This paper contributes with multiple overviews over cloud energy optimization techniques and classifies them. This comprehensive overview is a considerable tool to use when designing a new data center or when planning to reduce power consumption of an already deployed data center.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is offering utility-oriented IT services to users worldwide. Based on a pay-as-you-go model, it enables hosting of pervasive applications from consumer, scientific, and business domains. However, data centers hosting Cloud applications consume huge amounts of energy, contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. Therefore, we need Green Cloud computing solutions that can not only save energy for the environment but also reduce operational costs. This paper presents vision, challenges, and architectural elements for energy-efficient management of Cloud computing environments. We focus on the development of dynamic resource provisioning and allocation algorithms that consider the synergy between various data center infrastructures (i.e., the hardware, power units, cooling and software), and holistically work to boost data center energy efficiency and performance. In particular, this paper proposes (a) architectural principles for energy-efficient management of Clouds; (b) energy-efficient resource allocation policies and scheduling algorithms considering quality-of-service expectations, and devices power usage characteristics; and (c) a novel software technology for energy-efficient management of Clouds. We have validated our approach by conducting a set of rigorous performance evaluation study using the CloudSim toolkit. The results demonstrate that Cloud computing model has immense potential as it offers significant performance gains as regards to response time and cost saving under dynamic workload scenarios.},

	abstract = {© 2016 IEEE. There is mounting evidence that manufacturing energy and environmental costs are a growing factor in the overall energy footprint of computing systems. The quantification of these impacts requires the evaluation of both the manufacturing and use phase energy/environmental costs of major integrated circuit (IC) components, including processing units, memory, and storage. In particular, expansions of memory and cache can potentially increase manufacturing costs beyond what can be recovered through use phase advantages for reasonable usage patterns. With this holistic view of sustainability in mind, we provide evaluations of the environmental impacts of memory and cache options for Parsec and SPEC multi-program workloads. Using indifference point analysis, we determine which architectural decisions are the most sustainable in the context of these workloads for various usage scenarios. Through a form of break even analysis, we show the impact of upgrading to a new technology node. Our analysis of current processor trends indicates that upgrading may require upwards of 10 years of service time to break even, and that designing systems with smaller cache and main memory sizes may provide an overall positive environmental trend without dramatically reducing performance.},

These objects (“things”) are interacting autonomously, with minimal human intervention and connected to the Internet. Most of these objects are constrained in terms of resources, meaning that their intelligence is delegated to a smarter player, a software, identified as middleware. It is present in most IoT scenarios because it solves interoperability problems, allowing previously incompatible devices to communicate, while also integrates and makes decisions based on collected data. This paper presents a performance evaluation study of open-source middleware solutions, including a proprietary solution developed at Inatel for the Inatel Smart Campus. Performance metrics, both qualitative and quantitative to evaluate middleware solutions objectively are also proposed. The results are analyzed and it is concluded that the proposed metrics are well adjusted for this type of platforms and can play a key role when choosing the best middleware solution to deploy in a given IoT solution.

This paper presents an application for creating such a database by automatically extracting relevant information from HTML course outlines stored on an institution's website and storing it in machine-read-able XML. The developed application, called CODE (course outline data extractor), parses a course outline based on its HTML tags and content to build a document object model then applies a combination of web mining, natural language processing, and pattern recognition techniques to automatically classify and extract content useful for the semi-automatic e-Advisor and store it as XML. The current implementation is restricted to HTML course outlines, but the concepts can be extended to other formats of learning objects or entirely different domains. The quality of extraction and classification is evaluated for a corpus of syllabi as proof of concept.},

With continuous innovation on Web technology, Web sites have evolved from document Web to application Web and further to service Web recently. During the evolution course, Web sites serving dynamic content started to grow exponentially to dominate the area. Dynamic pages require servers to generate the response content per-user request before delivering it back to the user, which introduces network traffic, server workload and results in extra latency. This drew tremendous efforts from both research and industry on how to accelerate the dynamic content generation and distribution in order to reduce the user perceived latency and improve the application performance, among which caching is a vital technology. This paper attempts to survey the innovative research and products recently published in this area and presents them in a road map style. It first examines the dynamic characteristics of Web applications and the inherent challenges for caching. Then the rest of this paper explores the varied acceleration solutions on content generation process and content delivery process, respectively, followed by the analysis of how different caching solutions fit Web applications of different characteristics. Finally it ends with the future trends on Web caching technique and a summary of the survey.},

However, while previous research has addressed aspects of the sustainability affordances of Blockchain for Good projects, the constraints that these projects impose have not faced equal consideration. Furthermore, the theoretical concepts of sustainability 'problems' and 'solutions' implicit in these projects have not been made clear. In this exploratory study, we evaluate the sustainability of 28 Blockchain for Good projects that use cryptocurrencies or tradable tokens with regard to the UN sustainability goals. These projects span a range of goals, such as supply chain tracking, transparent charity, and fairer voting. Despite their admirable goals, we find that current Blockchain for Good projects are unlikely to contribute to a sustainable future due to technical limitations and a conceptual framing that favors the status quo rather than transformative change.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a knowledge-based Web Service composition system, called SWIM, which is based on the Service Domain model. Service Domains are communities of related Web Services that are mediated by a single Web Service, called the Mediator Service, which functions as a proxy for them. When a requestor sends a message to the Mediator Service one or more of the related Web Services are selected to dispatch the message and the results returned are aggregated to a single answer to the requestor. Mediator Services can be further composed to more complex Mediator Services that combine several selection and aggregation algorithms among many heterogeneous web services. The system utilizes the X-DEVICE deductive XML rule language for defining complex algorithms for selecting registered web services, combining the results, and synchronizing the workflow of information among the combined web services in a declarative way. In the paper, we demonstrate the flexibility and expressibility of our approach for composing Web Services using several e-business examples, covering most of the workflow patterns found in a comprehensive workflow management system (van der Aalst et al., Distributed and Parallel Databases, vol. 14, no, 1, pp. 5–15, 2003).},

These services are no longer solely based on internal enterprise systems, but often implemented, deployed and executed by diverse, external service providers. The ability to dynamically configure cross-organizational business processes with a mixture of internal and external services imposes new security requirements on existing security models. In this paper, we address the problem of defining and enforcing access control rules for securing service invocations in the context of a business process. For this purpose, we amortize existing role-based access control models that allow for dynamic delegation and retraction of authorizations. Authorizations are assigned on an event-driven basis, implementing a push-based interaction protocol between services. This novel security model is entitled the Event-driven Framework for Service Oriented Computing (EFSOC). In addition, this article presents an experimental prototype that is explored using a realistic case study.},

	abstract = {Die Digitalisierung der Industrie, auch „Industrie 4.0“ genannt, wird von zahlreichen Akteuren als Chance zur Reduktion der Umweltauswirkungen des industriellen Sektors betrachtet. Die wissenschaftlichen Bewertungen der Effekte der Digitalisierung der Industrie auf ökologische Nachhaltigkeit sind hingegen ambivalent. Diese kumulative Dissertation untersucht anhand von drei empirischen Studien die erwarteten und beobachteten Auswirkungen der Digitalisierung der Industrie auf ökologische Nachhaltigkeit. Ziel der Dissertation ist es, Chancen und Risiken der Digitalisierung auf verschiedenen System-Ebenen zu identifizieren und Handlungsoptionen in Politik und Industrie für eine nachhaltigere Gestaltung der Digitalisierung der Industrie abzuleiten. Ich nutze einen interdisziplinären, soziotechnischen Zugang und betrachte ausgewählte Länder des Globalen Südens (Studie 1) und das Beispiel Chinas (alle Studien). In der ersten Studie (Kapitel 2, gemeinsame Arbeit mit Marcel Matthess) untersuche ich mittels qualitativer Inhaltsanalyse Digital- und Industriestrategien aus sieben verschiedenen Ländern in Afrika und Asien auf politische Erwartungen hinsichtlich der Auswirkungen von Digitalisierung auf Nachhaltigkeit und vergleiche diese mit den erwartbaren Potenzialen der Digitalisierung für Nachhaltigkeit in den jeweiligen Länderkontexten. Die Analyse ergibt, dass die Dokumente ein breites Spektrum vager Erwartungen zum Ausdruck bringen, die sich eher auf positive indirekte Auswirkungen der Nutzung von Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie (IKT), wie etwa auf höhere Energieeffizienz und ein verbessertes Ressourcenmanagement, und weniger auf negative direkte Auswirkungen der IKT, wie etwa auf den Stromverbrauch durch IKT, beziehen. In der zweiten Studie (Kapitel 3, gemeinsame Arbeit mit Marcel Matthess, Grischa Beier und Bing Xue) führe und analysiere ich mittels qualitativer Inhaltsanalyse Interviews mit 18 Industrie-Vertreter*innen der Elektronikindustrie aus Europa, Japan und China zu Maßnahmen der Digitalisierung in Lieferketten. Wir stellen fest, dass zwar positive Erwartungen hinsichtlich der Effekte digitaler Technologien für Nachhaltigkeit der Lieferkette bestehen, deren tatsächlicher Einsatz und beobachtete Effekte jedoch noch begrenzt sind. Interviewpartner*innen können nur wenige Beispiele aus den eigenen Unternehmen nennen, die zeigen, dass durch die Digitalisierung der Lieferkette bereits Nachhaltigkeitsziele verfolgt oder Nachhaltigkeits-Effekte, wie Ressourceneinsparungen, nachweisbar erzielt wurden. In der dritten Studie (Kapitel 4, gemeinsame Arbeit mit Peter Neuhäusler, Marcel Matthess und Melissa Dachrodt) führe ich eine ökonometrische Panel-Daten-Analyse durch. Ich untersuche den Zusammenhang zwischen dem Grad von Industrie 4.0 und dem Energieverbrauch sowie der Energieintensität in zehn Fertigungssektoren in China im Zeitraum zwischen 2006 und 2019. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass es insgesamt keinen signifikanten Zusammenhang zwischen dem Grad von Industrie 4.0 und dem Energieverbrauch bzw. der Energieintensität in Fertigungs-Sektoren in China gibt. Es können jedoch Unterschiede in Sub-Gruppen von Sektoren festgestellt werden. Ich stelle eine negative Korrelation von Industrie 4.0 und Energieintensität in hoch digitalisierten Sektoren fest, was auf einen Effizienz-steigernden Effekt von Industrie 4.0 hindeutet. Andererseits besteht eine positive Korrelation von Industrie 4.0 und Energieverbrauch für Sektoren mit niedrigem Energieverbrauch, was dadurch erklärt werden könnte, dass Digitalisierung, etwa die Automatisierung zuvor hauptsächlich arbeitsintensiver Sektoren, Energie erfordert und außerdem Wachstumseffekte hervorruft. Im Diskussionsteil (Kapitel 6) dieser Dissertation nutze ich das Ordnungsschema der drei Ebenen Makro, Meso und Mikro, sowie von direkten und indirekten Umwelteffekten für die Einordnung der empirischen Beobachtungen in Chancen und Risiken, etwa hinsichtlich der Wahrscheinlichkeit von Rebound-Effekten der Digitalisierung auf Mikro-, Meso- und Makro-Ebene. Ich verknüpfe die untersuchten Akteurs-Perspektiven (Politiker*innen, Industrievertreter*innen), statistischen Daten und zusätzliche Literatur über die System-Ebenen hinweg und berücksichtige dabei auch Gedanken der politischen Ökonomik, um Handlungsfelder für nachhaltige(re) digitalisierte Industrien abzuleiten. Die Dissertation leistet damit zwei übergeordnete Beiträge zum wissenschaftlichen und gesellschaftlichen Diskurs. Erstens erweitern meine drei empirischen Studien den begrenzten Forschungsstand an der Schnittstelle zwischen Digitalisierung in der Industrie und Nachhaltigkeit, insbesondere durch Berücksichtigung ausgewählter Länder im Globalen Süden und des Beispiels Chinas. Zweitens ermöglicht die Erforschung des Themas durch Daten und Methoden aus unterschiedlichen disziplinären Kontexten und unter Einnahme eines soziotechnischen Standpunkts, eine Analyse von (Pfad-)Abhängigkeiten und Unsicherheiten im soziotechnischen System über verschiedene System-Ebenen hinweg, die in bisherigen Studien häufig nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt wurden. Die Dissertation soll so eine wissenschaftlich und praktisch relevante Wissensbasis für eine werte-gleitete, auf Nachhaltigkeit ausgerichtete Gestaltung der Digitalisierung der Industrie schaffen.},

Through a four-step process and a dedicated workshop with developers, the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF) is applied to capture and connect sustainability issues into dimensions and levels of effects. Among twenty sustainability issues in MAR applications, eight functional issues that are essential to creating a sustainable MAR travel guide experience were identified and developed for AudioNear. First, a comprehensive list of design suggestions was formulated to facilitate sustainability design in MAR applications. Then, high-fidelity mock-ups of AudioNear were developed based on design suggestions, indicating promising results in terms of the sustainability design process. This work contributes to the field of sustainability design and MAR.},

	abstract = {Cloud-native services face unique cybersecurity challenges due to their distributed infrastructure. They are susceptible to various threats like malware, DDoS attacks, and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. Additionally, these services often process sensitive data that must be protected from unauthorized access. On top of that, the dynamic and scalable nature of cloud-native services makes it difﬁcult to maintain consistent security, as deploying new instances and infrastructure introduces new vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, efﬁcient security solutions are needed to mitigate potential threats while aligning with the characteristics of cloud-native services. Despite the abundance of works focusing on security aspects in the cloud, there has been a notable lack of research that is focused on the security of cloud-native services. To address this gap, this work is the ﬁrst survey that is dedicated to exploring security in cloud-native services. This work aims to provide a comprehensive investigation of the aspects, features, and solutions that are associated with security in cloud-native services. It serves as a uniquely structured mapping study that maps the key aspects to the corresponding features, and these features to numerous contemporary solutions. Furthermore, it includes the identiﬁcation of various candidate open-source technologies that are capable of supporting the realization of each explored solution. Finally, it showcases how these solutions can work together in order to establish each corresponding feature. The insights and ﬁndings of this work can be used by cybersecurity professionals, such as developers and researchers, to enhance the security of cloud-native services.},

Three themes emerged and were evident across all three surveys, independent of their time point: The importance of community; making writing a legitimate part of people’s everyday work; and accountability, which is built into the structure of the “Power Hour Of Writing”. Our research indicates that regular, short timeslots for writing can have a valuable impact on staff and postgraduate researchers. Not only did this intervention help build the community at a time while people were working even more in isolation due to the pandemic, but it also highlighted to participants that protecting time for writing benefits their work.},

	abstract = {Software sustainability has generated much interest in the software engineering field in recent times, and has been widely investigated across different fields and from different standpoints. The relationship between software quality and software sustainability is still an open question. In this study, a literature survey and comparison was conducted using three-phases, having as a starting point the comparison of basic models for software quality. A follow-up study, conducted at a more comprehensive level to cover both basic models and the most cited tailored models. , Software sustainability literature is investigated to find the most frequent characteristics. Finally, data gathered from these studies and a comparison shows a similarity in the top level of these characteristics between software sustainability and software quality, and the emphasis on sustainability, maintainability and portability. The study suggests that ISO 25010 can be utilised by software sustainability. As a future work, the findings will be investigated empirically to support designing software sustainability framework identifying the most important criteria in the technical dimension.},

the scope, as well as by situating the issues addressed in the course in relation to their future profession. In this paper, we present our experiences of introducing and playing systems thinking games, how the systems thinking exercise sessions were conducted, outcomes of the sessions and finally some lessons learnt.

	abstract = {When designing a software system, architects make a series of design decisions that directly impact the system's quality. The number of available design alternatives grows rapidly with system size, creating an enormous space of intertwined design concerns that renders manual exploration impractical. We present eQual, a model-driven technique for simulation-based assessment of architectural designs. While it is not possible to guarantee optimal decisions so early in the design process, eQual improves decision quality. eQual is effective in practice because it (1) limits the amount of information the architects have to provide and (2) adapts optimization algorithms to effectively explore massive spaces of design alternatives. We empirically demonstrate that eQual yields designs whose quality is comparable to a set of systems' known optimal designs. A user study shows that, compared to the state-of-the-art, engineers using eQual produce statistically significantly higher-quality designs with a large effect size, are statistically significantly more confident in their designs, and find eQual easier to use.},

Many of us feel disconnected from our intuition, potentially causing us to struggle with confdently making decisions. Challenge: We set out to fnd out why that is and how to support aligned decision-making. Method: We interviewed fourteen experts on tuning into our intuition for decision-making, surveyed currently available decision-making support tools, and modeled a tool that extends current approaches with the expert insights. Results: Based on the experts’ insights, we modeled a decision trifecta including mind, heart, and gut along with a narrative of how to educate on their interplay and how to use that to take more aligned decisions. We critically question to what extent decision support technology is a benefcial way forward. Impact: The model opens up a space for discussion around holistic decision making from an individual’s perspective. It serves as a refection tool for personal processes as well as the suitability and limits of supportive technology},

Moreover, research in predicting student performance seeks to determine interrelated features and to identify the underlying reasons why certain features work better than others. This working group report presents a systematic literature review of work in the area of predicting student performance. Our analysis shows a clearly increasing amount of research in this area, as well as an increasing variety of techniques used.

This paper presents a tertiary study investigating the application of gamification in Software Engineering (SE) education. The study was conducted in response to recent systematic literature reviews and mappings on the topic. The findings reveal that the areas of SE most frequently gamified are Software Testing and Software Quality, with competition and cooperation being the most commonly utilized gamification elements. Additionally, the majority of studies focus on structural gamification, where game elements are employed to modify the learning environment without altering the content. The results demonstrate the potential of gamification to improve students’ engagement and motivation throughout the SE learning process, while also impacting other aspects such as performance improvement, skill development, and fostering good SE practices. However, caution is advised as unplanned and incorrectly applied gamification measures may lead to significant declines in performance and motivation.},

These publications cover various related topics including tool support for managing ADDs, human aspects in architectural decision making (ADM), and group decision making. The results 
of this paper should be treated as a getting-started guide for researchers who are entering the investigation phase of research on ADM. In this paper, the readers will find a brief description

Digital transformation projects are therefore in a unique position to realize the sustainable development agenda. Sustainability is a major social concern of our times and has been addressed extensively in the IS literature. Current discussions on sustainability are mainly following the United Nations report, focusing on goals around energy consumption, carbon footprint reduction and the like. We believe that a broad discussion on two fronts is needed: (1) ensuring that the development and use of information systems is in line with sustainability objectives, and (2) ensuring that th organization doesn’t falls back to the old ‘steady state’ after transformation initiatives are completed. The first contribution of this paper is a holistic definition of sustainable digital transformation, based on an literature research. The second contribution is the development of a fractal sustainable object model and an exploration into the impact of this model on enterprise modeling in two small cases. The first case is about environmental accounting, the second on the enterprise engineering method. We consider this paper to be a first in a series. The focus is on developing the overall framework with some ‘light weight’ validation. A full verification and implementation is left for future research.},

The second problem is the lack of developer-oriented representation approaches to ensure that all requirements relevant to sustainable software will be finally implemented. To address these two issues ShapeRE provides an alternative multi-dimensional approach for identifying requirements and a developer-oriented representation guideline. We suggest nine dimensions which are social, economic, environmental, technical, individual, purpose, design-aesthetics, integrative and legal. The design of our framework relies on insights from the fields of linguistics and empirical aesthetics, requirements engineering, and building architecture. We introduce the framework and discuss our evaluation strategy consisting of an online-experiment, a case study, and a survey.},

Students’ results for the fundamental subjects in the first semester were used as independent variables or input predictor variables while CGPA at semester eight was used as the output or the dependent variable. The study was done for two different entry points namely Matriculation and Diploma intakes. Performances of the models were measured using the coefficient of Correlation R and Mean Square Error (MSE). The outcomes from the study showed that fundamental subjects at semester one and three have strong influence in the final CGPA upon graduation.},

The academic performance in this study is measured by their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) upon graduating. In this study, the students’ demographic profile and the CGPA for the first semester of the undergraduate studies are used as the predictor variable for the students’ academic performance in the under-graduate degree program. Three predictive models have been developed, namely, logistic regression, artificial neural network (ANN) and Neuro-fuzzy. Performances of all the models were measured using root mean squared error (RMSE). The experiments indicate that Neuro-fuzzy model is better than logistic regression and ANN.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of how academic analytics has been used in educational institutions, what tools are available, and how institution can predict student performance and achievement. In addition, the study will discuss its applications, goals, examples, and why instructors want to make use of academic analytics. Finally, this paper will propose an intelligent recommendation intervention to improve students’ achievement that will be based on two outcomes; performance as measured by final grade, and students’ information data such as attendance, prerequisite subject, English and Mathematics marks, and suggests the use of Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree for predictive modeling.},

	abstract = {Typically, improving data center availability requires designing in more infrastructure; the antithesis of reducing costs. Is there a way to cut infrastructure, cost and emissions while improving energy efficiency and server availability? We consider and evaluate the integration of fuel cells with IT hardware with various architectural designs, essentially collapsing the entire energy supply chain, from power plant to power supply unit, into the confines of a single server cabinet. In this paper, we propose a distributed power architecture for fuel cell powered data centers to achieve high reliability and efficiency. We experimentally validate the design and demonstrate the use of a 10kW Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) stack and system as the distributed power source to power a server rack, eliminating the power distribution system in the data center and the grid outside of the data center. The PEMFC is found to respond quickly and reproducibly to both AC and DC load changes directly from the rack. By utilizing the fuel cell DC output, 53\% energy efficiency in a single server rack can be achieved. We also carry out cost analysis to quantify the cost savings that could be achieved with fuel cells placed in each rack. We evaluate and characterize the performance and the dynamic load following capability of the fuel cell. In addition , direct DC power from the fuel cell system eliminates the capital cost and operating conversion losses from systems that use energy storage and AC/DC conversion equipment.

	abstract = {GoF patterns are well-known best practices for the design of object-oriented systems. In this paper we aim at empirically assessing their relationship to energy consumption, i.e., a performance indicator that has recently attracted the attention of both researchers and practitioners. To achieve this goal, we investigate pattern-participating methods (i.e., those that play a role within the pattern) and compare their energy consumption to the consumption of functionally equivalent alternative (non-pattern) solutions. We obtained the alternative solution by refactoring the pattern instances using well-known transformations (e.g., replace polymorphism with conditional statements). The comparison is performed on 169 methods of two GoF patterns (namely State/Strategy and Template Method), retrieved from two well-known open source projects. The results suggest that for the majority of cases the alternative design excels in terms of energy consumption. However, in some cases (e.g., when the method is large in size or invokes many methods) the pattern solution presents similar or lower energy consumption. The outcome of our study can be useful to both researchers and practitioners, since we: (a) provide evidence on a possible negative effect of GoF patterns, and (b) can provide guidance on which cases the use of the pattern is not hurting energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Billions of dollars are spent every year for building and maintaining software. To reduce these costs we must identify the key factors that lead to better software and more productive development. One such key factor, and the focus of our paper, is the choice of programming language. Existing studies that analyze the impact of choice of programming language suffer from several deﬁciencies with respect to methodology and the applications they consider. For example, they consider applications built by different teams in different languages, hence fail to control for developer competence, or they consider small-sized, infrequently-used, short-lived projects. We propose a novel methodology which controls for development process and developer competence, and quantiﬁes how the choice of programming language impacts software quality and developer productivity. We conduct a study and statistical analysis on a set of long-lived, widely-used, open source projects—Firefox, Blender, VLC, and MySQL. The key novelties of our study are: (1) we only consider projects which have considerable portions of development in two languages, C and C++, and (2) a majority of developers in these projects contribute to both C and C++ code bases. We found that using C++ instead of C results in improved software quality and reduced maintenance effort, and that code bases are shifting from C to C++. Our methodology lays a solid foundation for future studies on comparative advantages of particular programming languages.},

By analyzing data from the Entreprenerdy EMS, we will investigate in which phases of the entrepreneurial process software startups have their sustainability foci.

We introduce XACT, a high-level approach for Java using XML templates as a first-class data type with operations for manipulating XML values based on XPath. In addition to an efficient runtime representation, the data type permits static type checking using DTD schemas as types. By specifying schemes for the input and output of a program, our analysis algorithm will statically verify that valid input data is always transformed into valid output data and that the operations are used consistently.},

In today’s digital, automated, and globally connected society, digitization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are among the fields that are taking the most relevance attention and societal impacts. The new technological development they imply and their use by an increasing part of the world population demonstrate that they must be driven by and for all people in society (across gender, culture, nationality, and other kinds of discrimination), protecting and achieving a positive impact on the environment, as well as a sustainable economy for all. Although the challenge is evident, progress has been invariably slow and addressed from isolated perspectives. The hUGe2 research program aims to address sustainability in and by technology (focusing on digitization and AI), analyzing from an interdisciplinary perspective the casuistry and existing discrimination (mainly due to gender imbalance, geographical inequalities, and lack of citizens’ engagement), and proposing new ways to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) tackling the intersectional challenges. To do this, it will be centered around four PhD students and their supervisors, which will investigate common case studies and data sets from different scientific perspectives.},

	abstract = {Technology is the catalyst for sustainable development. In this context, a key challenge for technology organizations is to balance sustainable development with conventional, profit-driven development. However, despite its significance, such a balance has largely been overlooked in the extant literature. In this study, we examine this balance through the novel lens of ambidexterity in order to understand how it is achieved. Accordingly, we conducted a case study at China Mobile, the world's largest telecommunication company, which recently launched a comprehensive Green-IT program with impressive results. Our study focused on four major stakeholders of the program: Top Management Team, Business Units, Supplier Network, and Customer Network. Two models were later derived by means of synthesized analyses of these four stakeholders: the process model, consisting of four phases, depicts an incremental and iterative development process and defines a step-by-step guideline to achieving a sustainable and profitable balance; the integrated model, consisting of four types of ambidexterity, delineates collective actions of the four major stakeholders and defines an overall guideline for them to collaborate. Both models are, to our best knowledge, the first of their kind in this new research field of sustainability and provide significant insights for future exploration. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

From its roots in qualitative descriptions of useful system organizations, software architecture has matured to encompass broad explorations of notations, tools, and analysis techniques. Whereas initially the research area interpreted software practice, it now offers concrete guidance for complex software design and development. We can understand the evolution and prospects of software architecture research by examining the research paradigms used to establish its results. These are, for the most part, the paradigms of software engineering. We advance our fundamental understanding by posing research questions of several kinds and applying appropriate research techniques, which differ from one type of problem to another, yield correspondingly different kinds of results, and require different methods of validation. Unfortunately, these paradigms are not recognized explicitly and are often not carried out correctly; indeed not all are consistently accepted as valid. This retrospective on a decade-plus of software architecture research examines the maturation of the software architecture research area by tracing the types of research questions and techniques used at various stages. We will see how early qualitative results set the stage for later precision, formality, and automation and how results build up over time. This generates advice to the field and projections about future impact.},

In the present work, we developed and evaluated a new approach that learns the building blocks of graphs that can be used to understand and generate new realistic graphs. Our key insight is that a graph's clique tree encodes robust and precise information. We show that a Hyperedge Replacement Grammar (HRG) can be extracted from the clique tree, and we develop a fixed-size graph generation algorithm that can be used to produce new graphs of a specified size. In experiments on large real-world graphs, we show that graphs generated from the HRG approach exhibit a diverse range of properties that are similar to those found in the original networks. In addition to graph properties like degree or eigenvector centrality, what a graph "looks like" ultimately depends on small details in local graph substructures that are difficult to define at a global level. We show that the HRG model can also preserve these local substructures when generating new graphs.},

We argue that successfully addressing these issues would promote the distribution and exchange of scholarly knowledge, on a technical as well as a theoretical level. The essay introduces ongoing work on a new data model for text called 'TAG' (Text-as-Graph) and its reference implementation 'Alexandria'. The essay outlines how TAG, based on a hypergraph for text, can improve the modeling of complex literary texts, and how Alexandria supports the exchange of markup files in a way that sustains scholarly discourse. We discuss three components of TAG: first, the markup technology stack allows for the formal definition of the meaning of markup ('markup semantics'); secondly, users can add multiple layers of markup that each represent an alternative perspective on text; and finally the editorial workflow is set up in a git-like distributed version management system. As a result, the TAG model provides for the synthesis of dispersed scholarly practices and the advancement of academic discourse.},

	title = {Colorful {XML}: {One} {Hierarchy} {Isn}'t {Enough}},
	abstract = {XML has a tree-structured data model, which is used to uniformly represent structured as well as semi-structured data, and also enable concise query specification in XQuery, via the use of its XPath (twig) patterns. This in turn can leverage the recently developed technology of structural join algorithms to evaluate the query efficiently. In this paper, we identify a fundamental tension in XML data modeling: (i) data represented as deep trees (which can make effective use of twig patterns) are often un-normalized, leading to update anomalies, while (ii) normalized data tends to be shallow, resulting in heavy use of expensive value-based joins in queries. Our solution to this data modeling problem is a novel multi-colored trees (MCT) logical data model, which is an evolutionary extension of the XML data model, and permits trees with multi-colored nodes to signify their participation in multiple hierarchies. This adds significant semantic structure to individual data nodes. We extend XQuery expressions to navigate between structurally related nodes, taking color into account, and also to create new colored trees as restructurings of an MCT database. While MCT serves as a significant evolutionary extension to XML as a logical data model, one of the key roles of XML is for information exchange. To enable exchange of MCT information, we develop algorithms for optimally serializing an MCT database as XML. We discuss alternative physical representations for MCT databases, using relational and native XML databases, and describe an implementation on top of the Timber native XML database. Experimental evaluation, using our prototype implementation, shows that not only are MCT queries/updates more succinct and easier to express than equivalent shallow tree XML queries, but they can also be significantly more efficient to evaluate than equivalent deep and shallow tree XML queries/updates.},

During the workshop, participants will be introduced to the principles of a distributed architecture for digital scholarly editions as they learn to work with the TAG reference implementation Alexandria . This implementation allows editors to import, edit, and export complex texts in a straightforward manner. Alexandria accommodates the encoding of multiple, coexisting views on text and thus supports various approaches to scholarly editing. Background},

Designing and implementing a markup language technology stack that supports overlap poses numerous challenges; the most prominent being that the markup language cannot be expressed in a recursive context-free (CF) grammar. In this short paper we discuss our experiments with parsing TAGML based on a context-sensitive grammar. Our current approach implements an attribute grammar, which consists of a CF grammar with semantic actions. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our approach, and sketch several alternative methods.

Vision based segmentation is one of the quality focused methods, which are considerably slow. This paper proposes an approach for boosting the perfor-mance of vision based algorithms. Our approach is based on concepts of modern web and a very common scenario in which an entire web site is processed at once. In this sce-nario, a great amount of performance boost can be gained by isomorphic mapping of previous results gathered from pages within the site to other pages on the same site. We provide the results of experiments performed on VIPS, the most common algorithm for page segmentation.},

Now, imagine what an application would look like if the application layer was moved from the server to the browser? The resulting system would have the browser communicating directly with the database server. In this system the behavior of the application would need to be fully described in the HTML itself. By embedding declarative tags in HTML the once static HTML can now become an interactive application capable of both persistence, and intelligent behavior. The resulting design allows a web-designer (not versed in server side technologies and languages) to build interactive web applications in hours rather than months, which is currently the norm with more traditional methods.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jss.2016.11.034},
	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Architectural tactics are the building blocks of software architecture. They describe solutions for address-ing specific quality concerns, and are prevalent across many software systems. Once a decision is made to utilize a tactic, the developer must generate a concrete plan for writing code and implementing the tactic. Unfortunately, this is a non-trivial task even for experienced developers. Often, developers resort to using search engines, crowd-sourcing websites, or discussion forums to find sample code snippets to implement a tactic. A fundamental problem of finding implementation for architectural tactics/patterns is the mismatch between the high-level intent reflected in the descriptions of these patterns and the low-level implementation details of them. To reduce this mismatch, we created a novel Tactic Search En-gine called ArchEngine (ARCHitecture search ENGINE). ArchEngine can replace this manual internet-based search process and help developers find and reuse tactical code from a wide range of open source sys-tems. ArchEngine helps developers find implementation examples of an architectural tactic for a given technical context. It uses information retrieval and program analysis techniques to retrieve applications that implement these design concepts. Furthermore, it lists and rank the code snippets where the pat-terns/tactics are located. Our case study with 21 graduate students (with experience level of junior soft-ware developers) shows that ArchEngine is more effective than other search engines (e.g., Krugle and Koders) in helping programmers to quickly find implementations of architectural tactics/patterns.},

	issn = {0301-9322},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2015.10.008},
	abstract = {Context: The term software reuse was first used in 1968 at the NATO conference. Since then, work in the scientific literature have stated that the application of software reuse offers benefits such as increase in quality and productivity. Nonetheless, in spite of many publications reporting software reuse experiences, evidence that such benefits having reached industrial settings is scarce. Objective: To identify and classify the benefits transferred to real-world settings by the application of software reuse strategies. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS). Our search strategies retrieved a set of 2,413 papers out of which 49 were selected as primary studies. We defined five facets to classify these studies: a) the type of benefit, b) the reuse process, c) the industry's domain, d) the type of reuse and e) the type of research reported. Results: Quality increase (28 papers) and Productivity increase (25 papers) were the two most mentioned benefits. Component- Based Development (CBD) was the most reported reuse strategy (41\%), followed by Software Product Lines (SPL, 30\%). The selected papers mentioned fourteen industrial domains, of which four stand out: aerospace and defense, telecommunications, electronics and IT services. The application of systematic reuse was reported in 78\% of the papers. Regarding the research type, 50\% use evaluation research as the investigation method. Finally, 13 papers (27\%) reported validity threats for the research method applied. Conclusions: The literature analyzed presents a lack of empirical data, making it difficult to evaluate the effective transfer of benefits to the industry. This work did not find any relationship between the reported benefits and the reuse strategy applied by the industry or the industry domain. Although the most reported research method was industrial case studies (25 works), half of these works (12) did not report threats to validity.},

For completeness, this research also investigated to see if software reuse had a predictive relationship to productivity and quality. The individual success factors were grouped into the following categories: management commitment, investment strategy, business strategy, technology transfer, organizational structure, process maturity, product-line approach, software architecture, availability of components, and quality of components. A questionnaire was developed to measure software reuse capability, productivity, quality, and the set of software reuse success factors. A survey was conducted to determine the state-of-the practice. The data from the survey was statistically analyzed to evaluate the relationships among reuse capability, productivity, quality, and the individual software reuse success factors. The results of the analysis showed some of the success factors to have a predictive relationship to software reuse capability. Software reuse capability also had a predictive relationship to productivity and quality. Based on the research results, the leading indicators of software reuse capability are: product-line approach, architecture which standardizes interfaces and data formats, common software architecture across the product-line, design for manufacturing approach, domain engineering, management which understands reuse issues, software reuse advocate(s) in senior management, state-of-the-art tools and methods, precedence of reusing high level software artifacts such as requirements and design versus just code reuse, and trace end-user requirements to the components which support them. © 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

	abstract = {Mining frequent tree patterns has many applications in different areas such as XML data, bioinformatics and World Wide Web. The crucial step in frequent pattern mining is frequency counting, which involves a matching operator to find occurrences (instances) of a tree pattern in a given collection of trees. A widely used matching operator for tree-structured data is subtree homeomorphism, where an edge in the tree pattern is mapped onto an ancestor-descendant relationship in the given tree. Tree patterns that are frequent under subtree homeomorphism are usually called embedded patterns. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for subtree homeomorphism with application to frequent pattern mining. We propose a compact data-structure, called occ, which stores only information about the rightmost paths of occurrences and hence can encode and represent several occurrences of a tree pattern. We then define efficient join operations on the occ data-structure, which help us count occurrences of tree patterns according to occurrences of their proper subtrees. Based on the proposed subtree homeomorphism method, we develop an effective pattern mining algorithm, called TPMiner. We evaluate the efficiency of TPMiner on several real-world and syn-thetic datasets. Our extensive experiments confirm that TPMiner always outperforms well-known existing algorithms, and in several cases the improvement with respect to existing algorithms is significant.},

	abstract = {Visual-textual presentation layout (e.g., digital magazine cover, poster, Power Point slides, and any other rich media), which combines beautiful image and overlaid readable texts, can result in an eye candy touch to at-tract users' attention. The designing of visual-textual presentation layout is therefore becoming ubiquitous in both commercially printed publications and online digital magazines. However, handcrafting aestheti-cally compelling layouts still remains challenging for many small businesses and amateur users. This article presents a system to automatically generate visual-textual presentation layouts by investigating a set of aesthetic design principles, through which an average user can easily create visually appealing layouts. The system is attributed with a set of topic-dependent layout templates and a computational framework inte-grating high-level aesthetic principles (in a top-down manner) and low-level image features (in a bottom-up manner). The layout templates, designed with prior knowledge from domain experts, define spatial layouts, semantic colors, harmonic color models, and font emotion and size constraints. We formulate the typogra-phy as an energy optimization problem by minimizing the cost of text intrusion, the utility of visual space, and the mismatch of information importance in perception and semantics, constrained by the automatically selected template and further preserving color harmonization. We demonstrate that our designs achieve the best reading experience compared with the reimplementation of parts of existing state-of-the-art designs through a series of user studies.},

In addition, one can easily encounter hyperlinked multimedia data such as image files, video clips, etc. on the Semantic Web. In this paper, we propose a browsing system called LIDAB which shows user-friendly views of different types of linked multimedia data sources on the Semantic Web. The motivation behind our research is to provide lay users without technical backgrounds on the Semantic Web with intuitive views on the linked multimedia data. While there exist well-known linked data browsing systems such as Tabulator, Disco, etc., using these systems are not always easy for novice users since they do not show intuitive views on browser screens. On the other hand, our system generates a view that looks almost like a normal HTML view that one can see on a Web browser. Our system has two types of audience: non-expert users who browse the information on the Semantic Web and Web designers who can create HTML documents. It is easy to use the proposed system in various educational scenarios where students can surf the Semantic Web to study learning materials.},

	title = {Detecting inconsistencies in multi-platform mobile apps},
	abstract = {—Due to the increasing popularity and diversity of mobile devices, developers write the same mobile app for different platforms. Since each platform requires its own unique environ-ment in terms of programming languages and tools, the teams building these multi-platform mobile apps are usually separate. This in turn can result in inconsistencies in the apps developed. In this paper, we propose an automated technique for detecting inconsistencies in the same native app implemented for iOS and Android platforms. Our technique (1) automatically instruments and traces the app on each platform for given execution scenarios, (2) infers abstract models from each platform execution trace, (3) compares the models using a set of code-based and GUI-based criteria to expose any discrepancies, and finally (4) generates a visualization of the models, highlighting any detected incon-sistencies. We have implemented our approach in a tool called CHECKCAMP. CHECKCAMP can help mobile developers in testing their apps across multiple platforms. An evaluation of our approach with a set of 14 industrial and open-source multi-platform native mobile app-pairs indicates that CHECKCAMP can correctly extract and abstract the models of mobile apps from multiple platforms, infer likely mappings between the generated models based on different comparison criteria, and detect inconsistencies at multiple levels of granularity.},

Moreover, quality assurance is complicated by service providers only giving information on their services in terms of domain specific concepts with only limited semantic meaning. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing service compositions based on pre-verified templates. Templates, given as workflow descriptions, are typed over a (domain-independent) template ontology defining concepts and predicates. Their meaning is defined by an abstract semantics, leaving the specific meaning of ontology concepts open, however, only up to given ontology rules. Templates are proven correct using a Hoare-style proof calculus, extended by a specific rule for service calls. Construction of service compositions amounts to instantiation of templates with domain-specific services. Correctness of an instantiation can then simply be checked by verifying that the domain ontology (a) adheres to the rules of the template ontology, and (b) fulfills the constraints of the employed template.},

The ACM suggests that there are five distinct computing disciplines – Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT), Information Systems (IS), Computer Engineering (CE), and Software Engineering (SE). In practice, it seems that there can be extensive overlap between these disciplines. For example, IS is defined by the ACM as computing in an organization context, typically in business while IT is defined as focusing on computing infrastructure and needs of individual users. If each of the different types of programs wishes to identify and attract interested students, it is important to understand if students perceive differences between them. This paper presents the results of a survey to determine if students differentiate between these five disciplines. Computing majors and non-majors were presented with several task descriptions commonly associated with each discipline and asked to identify them as belonging to one of the five disciplines. Data was collected from over 300 students at several different institutions and from a variety of different majors and computing disciplines. The results of the survey are presented along with comparisons of the perceptions of majors and non-majors.},

Research on Big Data, that is, the practice of gaining insights from it, challenges the intellectual, process, and computational limits of an enterprise. Leveraging the correct and appropriate toolset requires careful consideration of a large software ecosystem. Powerful algorithms exist, but the exploratory and often adhoc nature of analytic demands and a distinct lack of established processes and methodologies make it difficult for Big Data teams to set expectations or even create valid project plans. The exponential growth of data generated exceeds the capacity of humans to process it, and compels us to develop automated computing methods that require significant and expensive computing power in order to scale effectively. In this paper, we characterize data-driven practice and research and explore how we might design effective methods for systematizing such practice and research [19, 22].

Drawing on data from concept map-mediated interviews, this article oﬀers a counterview to recent studies that have depicted staﬀ understandings of SaP to be ﬁrmly located within a neoliberal discourse. Rather, our interviews portray surprising overlaps within students’ and leaders’ conceptualisations of SaP, depicting recurrent themes of communication, dialogue, community, and enabling students to escape neoliberal constructions: to become ‘more than customers’. This article ends with a consideration of how investigating the ways in which students and staﬀ conceptualise SaP can be valuable, as partnership approaches become further prioritised in institutional strategies.},

We present the results of 28 semi-structured interviews conducted with doctoral students from three European Union funded interdisciplinary research training networks to understand how they perceive the enhancers, inhibitors and manifestations of social capital within their networks. Key themes revolve around ‘extracting value from the interdisciplinary process’, ‘motivating students throughout the interdisciplinary programme journey’, and ‘relating to others both within and external to the programme’.

Drawing upon the mixed-method project that documented transitions to HE, we utilise interview data to illustrate the centrality of the epistemic and pedagogical struggles that students with vocational background experience. More speciﬁcally, a process of diﬀerential epistemic positioning is evident in the participants’ narratives. This manifests itself through a misrecognition of their worth in the ﬁeld of HE. Further, pedagogical struggles were also narrated by the participants in relation to the teaching, learning and assessment regimes prevailing in HEIs. The paper concludes by arguing for the need to revisit the narrow and static policy framing that emphasises barriers to access. This requires addressing questions pertaining to pedagogy and knowledge, students’ completion and retention rates and their ongoing engagement with the epistemic and pedagogical processes once they are within HE.},

The study ﬁnds support for the eﬀects of goal congruence between managers and educators and managerial incentives on educators’ intention to continue using elearning technology. Additionally, the results show that managerial goal congruence reduces the positive relationship between incentives and educators’ continuance intention. While the IS continuance model demonstrates an explained variance of 27\%, the full model explains 47\% of the dependent variable’s variance, indicating that the extended model is more powerful in explaining educators’ e-learning continuance than the IS continuance model in isolation.

	abstract = {Due to the changing landscapes of higher education, a large body of research has studied how scholars make sense of academic identities and careers. Yet, little is known about how academics actually ‘work’ on their identities to navigate normative demands and complex career structures. This paper explores how scholars negotiate career scripts trough identity work. Drawing upon 35 interviews with early career academics in political science and history, the analysis discerns four patterns of identity talk through which academic identities are constructed: achievement talk (signalling achievement and competitiveness), authenticity talk (signalling genuineness and being true to self), loyalty talk (signalling loyalty and willingness of helping out), and personation talk (adjustment to privileged identities). Deﬁning what to display and how to correctly embody its corresponding values, these patterns convey diﬀerent ways in which scholars manage their identities according to the perceived rules of recognition. Identifying several contrasting understandings of what it means to act and to represent worth, the study shows that successful identity management requires a certain feel for the game of recognition. Involving the symbolic struggle of ‘ﬁtting in’ and ‘standing out,’ strategies for identity work are shaped by scholars’ social class background and gender. In demonstrating how the prevalence of project-based work accentuates the importance of identity performances on academic markets, the ﬁndings suggest that the concept of identity labour may open up new avenues of investigation.},

	abstract = {Throughout the world of higher education, universities and colleges are reconceptualizing how their institutions are organized, especially in terms of faculty size related to overall programming. As adjunct rates increase and faculty positions are eliminated, many programs may be reduced to a single faculty lead. Yet, single faculty member programs are not well understood in the literature, nor are their roles in the larger higher education structure. This qualitative study explores the experiences of 12 university professors in the United States who coordinate single faculty programs, deﬁned as academic programs employing only one tenured or tenure-track faculty member. Using the conceptual frameworks of Role Theory and Social Isolation, we explored the experiences of single faculty and how those experiences were inﬂuenced by the policies and practices of their institutions. Participants’ experiences of isolation included disciplinary/collaborative isolation, physical isolation, ownership isolation, and identity isolation. Participants described their roles as complex, unclear, and often unrecognized by others. Results indicate that faculty in single faculty programs may appear invisible within the current structure of academia and that revising existing practices could better support these faculty and their programs. Institutions must question whether single faculty programs should exist and the conditions under which these programs can succeed. Finally, policy and practice recommendations are oﬀered for institutions, and even non-solo faculty peers, to support ﬂying solo professors as they navigate serving their students and keeping their programs aﬂoat.},

	abstract = {Student dropout is a frequent phenomenon in higher education institutions that entails high costs for individuals, institutions, and society as a whole. Thus, it is crucial to identify protective factors regarding dropout in cases in which it could have been prevented. In line with Person-Environment Fit Theory, we assume that intrinsic motivation for enrollment (i.e. choice of major based on personal interests) is an important protective factor that facilitates intrinsic learning motivation over time, which should in turn be positively associated with performance at university and negatively associated with dropout (intentions). We tested these assumptions in two longitudinal studies using structural equation modeling. In study 1, we found that intrinsic motivation for enrollment was associated with a positive development of intrinsic learning motivation (N = 774 students, two time points during the ﬁrst two semesters). In study 2, we investigated whether intrinsic learning motivation mediated the association between intrinsic motivation for enrollment and study success variables (N = 1185 students, three time points during the ﬁrst academic year). Intrinsic motivation for enrollment was only slightly positively associated with university GPA, but negatively with students’ dropout intention measured one year later – mediated via intrinsic learning motivation. We did not ﬁnd an association between intrinsic motivation for enrollment and actual dropout. The presented research provides the foundation for a process model linking the quality of motivation for enrollment to study success, which has strong implications for counseling of prospective students as well as for the identiﬁcation of students at risk.},

A literature scoping review is applied to chart various conceptual, theoretical and operational applications of resilience and wellbeing in HE. Twenty-seven (27) articles are identiﬁed and analysed. The scoping review ﬁnds that two general approaches to implementing resilience and wellbeing training exist in HE. First, articles reacting to a decline in student mental health and remedying this decline through general extra-curricular resilience or wellbeing programmes. Second, articles opting for a curricula and discipline-speciﬁc approach by establishing why resilience will be needed by future graduates before developing and testing new learning experiences. The presence of cognitive ﬂexibility, storytelling, reframing and reﬂection lie at the core of the practice of resilience and design and therefore oﬀer preliminary opportunities to develop ‘designer resilience’ training.

	abstract = {Student engagement research in university students has been scarce, despite its major positive role on performance, degree completion and mental health. Social and emotional competencies, which are currently called twenty-ﬁrst-century skills, exert some impact on student engagement in youth. Since engagement is cultural-sensitive, individual (social and emotional competencies) and cross-cultural (human developmental index and unemployment rate) characteristics were examined in association with student engagement in youth. This study included 2,092 participants from nine countries/regions, aged between 17 and 27 years (M = 21.52, SD = 2.27), mostly cisgender woman (n = 1,035, 68.7\%) and undergraduate (n = 1,401, 96.2\%). Data were collected using a cross-sectional online survey that included the Student Engagement Scale, the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire, and the prosocial behaviour/resources subscale of the Strengths and Diﬃculties Questionnaire. Multilevel-models showed that social and emotional competencies were relevant predictors of student engagement independently of the country-level variables. Moreover, student engagement varied with country/region human development and unemployment rate, with students from higher developed countries/regions and lowered unemployment reporting lower engagement. This study reinforces the need to implement evidencebased social and emotional learning programmes in universities worldwide, as well as public policies that can inﬂuence engagement and protect youth.},

Its objective is to determine the extent to which these beliefs and attitudes depend on students’ prior experience with group work, their motivation for studying, and their approach to learning. The study is based on the responses of 172 ﬁrst-year university students to a questionnaire combining closed- and open-ended questions. The study shows that most students had a positive perception of group work, but did not spontaneously mention as beneﬁts knowledge learning or the development of some crosscutting skills put forward by research on cooperative learning. It was found that the degree of reluctance towards group work is related to a low perception of its learning gains and the idea that it faces organizational constraints. The results also oﬀer new insights into the origins of these beliefs and attitudes. The frequency of prior experience of group works is positively correlated with the perceived learning gains and negatively correlated with reluctance to work in groups. When considering motivation and deep approach to learning and their sub-dimensions, reﬂective approach to learning was found to be the main factor determining the perceived learning gains. These results suggest two avenues for teaching based on cooperative learning: discuss and clarify with students the mechanisms of cooperative learning, and structure the teaching to engage them in discussions to collectively self-regulate their activities.},

However, how perceived employability is shaped in the university setting is still underresearched.

We draw on Conservation on Resources Theory to hypothesise a positive impact of support from teaching staﬀ on students’ perceived employability. In addition, we contend that perceived employability predicts students’ psychological well-being. To test our hypotheses, one hundred twenty-seven university students completed a survey three times over a 10-month period. The results conﬁrm that support from teaching staﬀ enhances students’ perceived employability. Moreover, a positive eﬀect of perceived employability on students’ psychological well-being emerges. Perceived employability also appears to mediate the relationship between support from teaching staﬀ and psychological well-being. Using a time-lagged approach, this study enhances the empirical knowledge about antecedents and outcomes of students’ perceived employability.

	abstract = {The recruitment of doctoral graduates yields collective knowledge, skills, networking, and prestige benefits to organisations, and to UK industries. As individuals though, do graduates experience overall benefit from their doctorate, and how do they perceive the value that engaging with doctoral study confers? This interview study used a critical, interpretive lens to examine perceptions of value across experiences of doctoral education and asked specifically about the utility of doctoral skills, behaviours, and competencies when translated into different workplaces. It presents some of the first insights into how doctoral value is perceived by graduates and the costs and benefits of doctoral study within and beyond the academy. Doctoral graduates (n = 22) identified four domains of doctoral value: (1) career value; (2) skills value; (3) social value; (4) personal value. These were influenced by factors experienced both during and after their degrees: (1) time since graduation; (2) supervision; (3) accrued social connectivity; (4) employer value of the doctorate. Our conceptual model of doctoral value contributes to international higher education knowledge by providing a structure for enhancing the doctoral experience and its benefits, both during study and for entering the job market.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Software engineering is a human activity. People naturally make sense of their activities and experience through storytelling. But storytelling does not appear to have been properly studied by software engineering research. AIM: We explore the question: what contribution can storytelling make to human--centric software engineering research? METHOD: We define concepts, identify types of story and their purposes, outcomes and effects, briefly review prior literature, identify several contributions and propose next steps. RESULTS: Storytelling can, amongst other contributions, contribute to data collection, data analyses, ways of knowing, research outputs, interventions in practice, and advocacy, and can integrate with evidence and arguments. Like all methods, storytelling brings risks. These risks can be managed. CONCLUSION: Storytelling provides a potential counter--balance to abstraction, and an approach to retain and honour human meaning in software engineering.},

	abstract = {The field of structural computing is working to produce techniques and tools to ease the task of developing application infrastructure. This paper describes the Themis structural computing environment. Themis provides developers with a generic structure server and two key extension mechanisms that enable the rapid creation of tools for a variety of application domains. The two novel extension mechanisms enable support for structure templates and automated structure transformation. Each of these mechanisms is described in detail along with the interfaces and capabilities of the generic structure server. We evaluate the utility of Themis in supporting the migration of the InfiniTe information integration environment from an XML-based repository to the Themis structure server. The use of Themis has led to a significant reduction in the number of lines of code required to produce the InfiniTe prototype. In addition, the higher level of abstraction provided by Themis has led to code that is easier to understand and maintain than the XML-based code it replaces. The paper concludes with a discussion of how structural computing tools can impact and influence software engineering and software engineering research.},

However, automation, especially for maintaining or adapting large hypermedia documents (e.g. a web site), is a must.

The main idea is to start with a set of mediaobjects (text, images, video, etc.), select the most appropriate ones, sequence them to build a tree-like structure, integrate them into a set of screen pages, and finally convert each screen page into a single HTML file. Maintaining the resulting document is very easy because it only requires extending or modifying the pool of mediaobjects available and regenerating the document.},

	abstract = {W riting an abstract may seem like a daunting task especially for the novice. Many authors struggle with this task, although it is an important first step for a poster, a presentation, or an article. This article aims to give the abstract writer guidelines for submitting an abstract with the intent of aiding the writer to submit a successful abstract. While these guidelines are focused toward a PENS poster abstract, the concepts can be transferred to other abstract submissions. Purpose of the Abstract The abstract serves three major functions. First, it enables the review committee (PENS Research Committee) to determine the relevance, as well as the quality of the presentation planned. Second, it allows the Conference Planning Committee to organize into themes. Third, the abstract serves to provide information to conference attendees regarding poster presentations when choosing which posters to view (Happell, 2008). The abstract is a glimpse of what is yet to come, as well as a summary of what will be included in the poster presentation. It is not merely an introduction to the presentation, but rather showcases what is contained within the presentation (Watson, 2006). A poorly written abstract may be indicative of a poorly constructed poster, whereas a well-written abstract usually is representative of a well-designed poster. Review the Abstract Guidelines for Submission Before submitting an abstract, review the guidelines for submission and formulate a firm idea about the content of the abstract and ultimately, the poster. Ideas can be generated from research projects, evidence-based practice projects, clinical projects, as well as interesting or unusual cases that are encountered in clinical practice. Additionally, informational posters can be presented to showcase information that is not related to a research project or case presentation. The most common reason for an abstract to be rejected is not adhering to the abstract submission requirements. Review the abstract guidelines on the PENS website and determine which category is most appropriate for the abstract idea. (PENS Research Committee reserves the right to assign the poster to a different category if it is more appropriate for a different category, based on the information submitted in the abstract.) Note that each category of poster abstract has a slightly different formatting requirement. The abstract formatting is designed to model the poster headings. PENS abstracts are submitted electronically via the PENS website. Pay attention to the abstract due date, as late submissions are a cause for abstract rejection. Common Errors in Abstract Writing A common error when writing an abstract is waiting until the last minute to prepare the abstract. Many of the other common errors can be eliminated if one plans enough time in the process. It allows you to review, ask for feedback and revise before submitting your abstract. Another common error in abstract writing is length of submission. Pay attention to the word limit in the abstract instructions. Abstracts that contain only one or two sentences do not adequately convey what is proposed for the presentation. Conversely, abstracts that are lengthy make evaluation difficult as the reviewers may need to read through unnecessary information to determine what is actually proposed for the presentation. Adherence to suggested headings make the review process simpler, as well as guides the abstract writer to include required information. Other errors are grammatical, spelling and typographical. A poor writing style may convey lack of organization or carelessness to the review committee. When abstracts are written hurriedly, the writer may omit checking for errors. The Research Committee is available to mentor PENS members in abstract writing. While writing an abstract may seem like a daunting task, advance preparation and careful attention to the guidelines can make this process successful. Guidance from an experienced colleague is a valuable resource for the novice writer/presenter.},

@article{Cavage2013,
	title = {Building a distributed system requires a methodical approach to requirements},
	abstract = {Distributed systems are difficult to understand, design, build, and operate. They introduce exponentially more variables into a design than a single machine does, making the root cause of an application problem much harder to discover. It should be said that if an application does not have meaningful SLAs (service-level agreements) and can tolerate extended downtime and/or performance degradation, then the barrier to entry is greatly reduced. Most modern applications, however, have an expectation of resiliency from their users, and SLAs are typically measured by " the number of nines " (e.g., 99.9 or 99.99 percent availability per month). Each additional 9 becomes harder and harder to achieve. To complicate matters further, it is extremely common that distributed failures will manifest as intermittent errors or decreased performance (commonly known as brownouts). These failure modes are much more time-consuming to diagnose than a complete failure. For example, Joyent operates several distributed systems as part of its cloud-computing infrastructure. In one such system—a highly available, distributed key/value store—Joyent recently experienced transient application timeouts. For most users the system operated normally and responded within the bounds of its latency SLA. However, 5-10 percent of requests exceeded a predefined application timeout. The failures were not reproducible in development or test environments, and they would often " go away " for minutes to hours at a time. Troubleshooting this problem to root cause required extensive system analysis of the data-storage API (node.js), an RDBMS (relational database management system) used internally by the system (PostgreSQL), the operating system, and the end-user application that relied on the key/value system. Ultimately, the root problem was in application semantics that caused excessive locking, but determining the root cause required considerable data gathering and correlation, and consumed many working hours of time among engineers with differing areas of expertise. The entire preamble is fairly common knowledge to engineers working on distributed systems, and the example application degradation is typical of a problem that arises when operating a large system. Current computing trends, however, are bringing many more organizations and applications into the distributed-computing realm than was the case only a few years ago. There are many reasons why an organization would need to build a distributed system, but here are two examples: • The demands of a consumer Web site/API or multitenant enterprise application simply exceed the computing capacity of any one machine. • An enterprise moves an existing application, such as a three-tier system, onto a cloud service provider in order to save on hardware/data-center costs. The first example is typical of almost any Internet-facing company today. This has been well discussed for many years and is certainly a hotbed for distributed-systems research and innovation, and yet it is not a solved problem. Any application going live still needs to assess its own},

Based on immediate parsing and analyses, modern textual code editors are also increasingly syntax-aware: structure and textual editors are converging into a new editing paradigm that combines text and templates. Current text-based language workbenches require redundant specification of the ingredients for a template-based editor, which is detrimental to the quality of syntactic completion, as consistency and complete-ness of the definition cannot be guaranteed. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a specification language for syntax definition based on templates.

This model is based upon an understanding of learning in the context of designing learning experiences and utilises a game-based model of learning to understand the importance of motivation and autonomy in learners to enhance and accelerate learning. The framework is developed and reﬂected upon by analysing two cases: a medical triage case in which the timing and frequency of feedback proved critical, and a business simulation which illuminated the need for a range of types of feedback and to be aware of the possibility of different agents (instructor peer and game) that can deliver feedback. The extended model may help game and learning designers alike to discern different types of feedback, both in games and more generally, in more explicit and nuanced ways.},

@phdthesis{Broman2021,

	title = {The {Broken} {Windows} {Theory} in {Software} {Engineering}},
	abstract = {Context: The term technical debt (TD) describes the aggregation of sub-optimal
solutions that serve to impede the evolution and maintenance of a system. Some
claim that the broken windows theory (BWT), a concept borrowed from criminology,
applies to software development projects. The theory states that the presence of
indications of previous crime (such as a broken window) will increase the likelihood
of further criminal activity; TD could be considered the broken windows of software
systems.
Objective: To empirically investigate the causal relationship between the TD density
of a system and the propensity of developers to introduce new TD during the
extension of that system. Primarily in situations where there are no significant hurdles
to implementing a low TD solution (i.e., when there is no TD that practically
forces the implementation of new TD).
Method: The study used a mixed-methods strategy consisting of a controlled experiment
and accompanying follow-up interviews. The experiment had a total of
29 developers of varying experience levels complete small system extension tasks in
systems with high or low TD density; most subjects completed one of each for a
total of 51 solution submissions. The solutions were scanned for TD, both manually
and using SonarQube. A subset of subjects volunteered to participate in interviews,
the results of which were evaluated using thematic analysis.
Result: Bayesian data analysis revealed significant effects of TD level on the
subjects’ tendency to reimplement (rather than reuse) functionality, choose nondescriptive
variable names, and introduce other code smells identified by SonarQube,
all with at least 95\% certainty. Additionally, subjects appeared to be, at least partially,
aware of when they had introduced TD. The results of the thematic analysis
were in line with the findings of the experiment.
Conclusion: Three separate significant results along with a validating qualitative
result combine to form substantial evidence of the BWTs applicability to software
engineering contexts.},

	abstract = {Social inclusion is a fundamental feature of thriving societies. This paper first investigates barriers for social inclusion in online Software Engineering (SE) communities, by identifying a set of 11 attributes and organising them as a taxonomy. Second, by applying the taxonomy and analysing language used in the comments posted by members in 189 Gitter projects (with {\textgreater} 3 million comments), it presents the evidence for the social exclusion problem. It employs a keyword-based search approach for this purpose. Third, it presents a framework for improving social inclusion in SE communities.},

In addition to their functional and extra-functional properties, nowadays’ systems are also evaluated by their sustainability properties. The next generation of systems will be characterized by an overall elevated sustainability—including their post-life, driven by efficient value retention mechanisms. Current systems engineering practices fall short to support these ambitions and need to be revised appropriately. In this paper, we introduce the concept of circular systems engineering, a novel paradigm for systems sustainability. After defining a conceptual reference framework to situate systems engineering practices within, we derive prerequisites for circular systems engineering. Finally, we outline the challenges and research opportunities associated with circular systems engineering.},

Limited research has focused on the eﬀects of casualisation on research academics and the institutions in which they work. This paper draws on interviews with 26 contract researchers, who have worked in the US, UK, and Australia. Drawing on the construct of ‘Othering’, identiﬁed in our interviews we explore the work of academics employed casually or on contract. Using a Foucauldian lens to make visible and disrupt regimes of truth about academic work, we found that there are numerous ways in which institutional discourses and practices marginalise casual academics and conceal the challenges they face. We argue that the disruption of dominant discourses about academic work is one way of supporting academics whose employment is insecure.},

The current approach to quest design is dominated by a task-orientated paradigm in which a quest is viewed as a series of tasks to be completed as part of the narrative structure of the game. This paper presents an alternative paradigm that shifts away from the predominant taskbased approach to quest design. Based on a study of existing quest models, a dual quest framework of singular and synergy quests is proposed. Within the frameworks, tasks become an intermediary step within the quest which is now focused on the transﬁguration of the player character. This approach offers a practical design structure for both procedural and manual quest design.},

It is the Erasmus+ project No. 2020-1-PT01-KA203-078646 - Sustrainable. More details can be found at the project web site https://sustrainable.github.io/ One of the most important contributions of the project are two summer schools. The 2nd SusTrainable Summer School (SusTrainable - 23) will be organized at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, in the week July 10-14, 2023. The summer school will consist of lectures and practical work for master and PhD students in computing science and closely related fields. There will be contributions from Babe{\textbackslash}c\{s\}-Bolyai University, E{\textbackslash}"\{o\}tv{\textbackslash}"\{o\}s Lor{\textbackslash}'\{a\}nd University, Juraj Dobrila University of Pula, Radboud University Nijmegen, Roskilde University, Technical University of Ko{\textbackslash}v\{s\}ice, University of Amsterdam, University of Coimbra, University of Minho, University of Plovdiv, University of Porto, University of Rijeka. To prepare and streamline the summer school, the consortium organized a teacher training in Pula, Croatia. This was an event of five full days, organized by Tihana Galinac Grbac and Neven Grbac. The Juraj Dobrila University of Pula is very concerned with the sustainability issues. The education, research and management are conducted with sustainability goals in mind. The contributions in the proceedings were reviewed and provide a good overview of the range of topics that will be covered at the summer school. The papers in the proceedings, as well as the very constructive and cooperative teacher training, guarantee the highest quality and beneficial summer school for all participants.},

	abstract = {This thesis focuses on the environmental impact of the Internet and the need for Sustainable Web
Design practices. The Web demands significant computational power and electricity, which contributes to climate change. The goal of this thesis is to minimize the carbon footprint of the Web
by investigating the awareness, practices, challenges, and barriers faced by both industry and
academia. This thesis presents research conducted for Yavuz Inal on behalf of the Department
of Design at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology. It is divided into three studies: Awareness and Practices, Challenges and Barriers, and Guidelines. The studies in this thesis
investigate Sustainable Web Design, by examining developers’ awareness and practices, identifying current challenges and barriers to implementation, and proposing practices that should
be included in dedicated guidelines for Sustainable Web Design. By studying these aspects, the
thesis intends to provide practical guidelines for Sustainable Web Design to help stakeholders
prioritize sustainability in web solutions and collectively reduce the carbon footprint of the web.
Additionally, the research findings will be presented at relevant Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) conferences, and disseminated along with the guidelines on a website developed by the
group.},

	title = {The future of education and skills {Education} 2030},
	abstract = {We are facing unprecedented challenges – social, economic and environmental – driven by accelerating globalisation
and a faster rate of technological developments. At the same time, those forces are providing us with myriad new
opportunities for human advancement. The future is uncertain and we cannot predict it; but we need to be open and
ready for it. The children entering education in 2018 will be young adults in 2030. Schools can prepare them for jobs
that have not yet been created, for technologies that have not yet been invented, to solve problems that have not yet
been anticipated. It will be a shared responsibility to seize opportunities and find solutions.
To navigate through such uncertainty, students will need to develop curiosity, imagination, resilience and selfregulation; they will need to respect and appreciate the ideas, perspectives and values of others; and they will need to
cope with failure and rejection, and to move forward in the face of adversity. Their motivation will be more than getting
a good job and a high income; they will also need to care about the well-being of their friends and families, their
communities and the planet.
Education can equip learners with agency and a sense of purpose, and the competencies they need, to shape their own
lives and contribute to the lives of others. To find out how best to do so, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) has launched The Future of Education and Skills 2030 project. The aim of the project is to
help countries find answers to two far-reaching questions:
● What knowledge, skills, attitudes and values will today's students need to thrive and shape their world?
● How can instructional systems develop these knowledge, skills, attitudes and values effectively?
This position paper describes the first results from this work. The initial framework was reviewed, tested and validated
in an iterative process involving a range of stakeholders from around the world. They ensured that the framework is
relevant across the globe, consistent with wider policies and can be implemented. We will finalise the framework by the
end of 2018. In 2019, we will change gears and begin to explore the translation of the framework into pedagogy,
assessment and the design of an instructional system.
Working with policy makers, academic experts, school networks, teachers, education leaders, students and social partners,
the framework provides a space in which to exchange ideas, compare proven and promising practices, discover cuttingedge research and contribute to a new ecosystem of learning. If you’d like to join us, please get in touch.},

	title = {A biomimetic view on complex software systems and the consequences for digital sustainability},
	abstract = {Nowadays, individual software often plays a part in large complex software systems.
A system like this develops new characteristics, potentials, and risks, much like a
multicellular organism, displays different properties than the unicellular organisms that it
is made of. This phenomenon is called Emergence as it describes the emerging behaviour
and features of a system due to the interaction of underlying components.
Emerging behaviour and other systemic properties are rarely considered in software
systems during the development process. In a world of increasing complexity, this poses
a great risk and has already led to significant issues in the past.
We are missing clear guidelines and considerations for the development stage of software
in complex systems, but also for previous stages such as requirements engineering and
following stages such as testing and maintenance. Developing these criteria for a new
programming paradigm requires us to understand the underlying complexity phenomena,
as well as the systemic behaviour of complex software systems.
The aim of this work is to research what we can learn from biology and other disciplines,
and how their concepts can be operationalised for the software development process.
Interview rounds with an interdisciplinary expert panel shall guide the compilation of a
new paradigm (or at least its criteria), which will be evaluated by the following content
analysis and a second interview round.},

Theoretical discussions in environmental and sustainability education (ESE) research and feminist research will be introduced to develop an understanding of care for education. Those theories will be illustrated and motivated based on concrete examples in computing and computing education. The participants get to choose among four different topics of discussion in the session, 1) the role of education to prepare for care, 2) theoretical discussions of care as a concept to develop education and education research, 3) pedagogical methods to foster care, 4) care and responsibility in the curriculum. The outcome of this session is twofold: The participants will gain new ways of conceiving education for human and planetary well-being and they will get to know researchers and educational developers with an interest in and experiences with sustainability education.},

Large-scale scientiﬁc projects are vast in scope, with lifespans measured in decades and costs exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. Successfully designing software that can exist for that span of time, at that scale, is challenging for even the most capable software companies. Yet scientiﬁc endeavors face challenges with funding, staﬃng, and operate in complex, poorly understood software settings. In this paper we discuss the practice of early-phase softwarearchitecture in the Square Kilometre Array Observatory’s Science Data Processor. The Science Data Processor is a critical software component in this next-generation radio astronomy instrument. We customized an existing set of processes for software architecture analysis and design to this project’s unique circumstances. We report on the series of comprehensive software architecture plans that were the result. The plans were used to obtain construction approval in a critical design review with outside stakeholders. We conclude with implications for other long-lived software architectures in the scientiﬁc domain, including potential risks and mitigations.},

Therefore, not only does the strength and thermal properties of the material selected for construction have major importance, but also the environmental impact of the material and the amount of energy spent to extract, manufacture and transport the materials. The paper presents the thermal calculations for envelope structures, assessing their environmental impact with respect to three parameters: carbon dioxide emissions, total energy consumption and amount of waste generated during material production. The research method used was an analysis of documents from real manufacturers and calculations of the main environmental parameters. Our investigation has led us to conclude that the largest amount of carbon dioxide emissions is produced by structures containing reinforced concrete, since the weight fraction of concrete is signiﬁcantly greater than that of all other compared materials. The largest amount of non-renewable energy is consumed by structures containing clay bricks and reinforced concrete, since they consist of natural sources. The largest amount of waste is generated by structures containing expanded polystyrene and reinforced concrete consisting of cement, whose production in turn generates a large amount of waste.},

Twelve first-year and eight senior engineering students generated solutions to 10 design problems. Half of the problems included additional dimensions of sustainability. The number of unique design solutions students developed and their neurocognitive activation were measured. Without additional requirements for sustainability, first-year students generated significantly more solutions than senior engineering students. First-year students recruited higher cortical activation in the brain region generally associated with cognitive flexibility, and divergent and convergent thinking. Senior engineering students recruited higher activation in the brain region generally associated with uncertainty processing and self-reflection. When additional dimensions of sustainability were present, first-year students produced fewer solutions. Senior engineering students generated a similar number of solutions. Senior engineering students required less cortical activation to generate a similar number of solutions. The varying patterns of cortical activation and different number of solutions between first-year and senior engineering students begin to highlight cognitive differences in how students manage and retrieve information in their brain during design. Students’ ability to manage complex requirements like sustainability may improve with education.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Moreover, both classroom performance goal structures and personal performance-avoidance goals had maladaptive patterns of relations to outcomes at their respective levels of analysis, whereas classroom mastery goal structures and personal mastery goals showed adaptive relations.

The present study develops a model of the decision to withdraw drawing on theories of voluntary employee turnover from organizational psychology and signal detection theory from the cognitive sciences. The model posits that precipitating events or shocks (e.g., changes in tuition) lead students to consider withdrawing from the university. If the evidence surpasses a criterion then the student decides to withdraw. The model was used to identify shocks students were sensitive to and to test hypotheses about the underlying decision process.

	abstract = {This paper examines factors linked to first year attrition within the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree at an Australian university. Drawing on a broad range of institutional data, the authors considered correlations between attrition and several variables. Our research revealed the need to move beyond analysis of geo-demographic factors towards indicators of student choice and educational achievement. While few demographic factors were found to be strong indicators of attrition, two other factors were clearly correlated. These factors –course preference, and first year educational performance – were significant predictors of attrition. Because subject failure is the single strongest predictor of attrition, and because the BA offers a wide range of subjects, developing strategies to ensure consistency and quality across those subjects is imperative.},

While all of the teacher effect estimates we considered were significant predictors of student achievement under random assignment, those that controlled for prior student test scores yielded unbiased predictions and those that further controlled for mean classroom characteristics yielded the best prediction accuracy. In both the experimental and non-experimental data, we found that teacher effects faded out by roughly 50 percent per year in the two years following teacher assignment.},

The study population consisted of 10th and 11th grade 922 VTS students in Turkey and 1050 VTS students in Malaysia. The study was conducted with the screening model, and a 34-item demographic questionnaire was developed for the collection of data Using the SPSS 24.0, the KR20 reliability coefficient of the questionnaire was found to be .90. The items in the questionnaire that were believed to affect academic achievement were accepted as independent variable/input, and the academic achievement averages of students in the previous year’s physics, chemistry and biology courses were considered as dependent variables/output. Using these parameters, a model was created and the academic achievements of the students were predicted with ANN using the Matlab R2016a program. At the end of the study, a successful academic achievement prediction system was developed with an average 98.0\% sensitivity over 922 samples for Turkey and with a 95.7\% sensitivity over 1050 samples for Malaysia, and the measures to be taken were determined in order the prevent failure of students.},

	abstract = {Predicting students performance becomes more challenging due to the large volume of data in educational databases. Currently in Malaysia, the lack of existing system to analyze and monitor the student progress and performance is not being addressed. There are two main reasons of why this is happening. First, the study on existing prediction methods is still insuﬃcient to identify the most suitable methods for predicting the performance of students in Malaysian institutions. Second is due to the lack of investigations on the factors aﬀecting students achievements in particular courses within Malaysian context. Therefore, a systematical literature review on predicting student performance by using data mining techniques is proposed to improve students achievements. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview on the data mining techniques that have been used to predict students performance. This paper also focuses on how the prediction algorithm can be used to identify the most important attributes in a students data. We could actually improve students achievement and success more eﬀectively in an eﬃcient way using educational data mining techniques. It could bring the beneﬁts and impacts to students, educators and academic institutions.},

To do so, most existing studies have used the traditional machine learning algorithms to predict students’ achievement based on their behavior data, from which behavior features are extracted manually thanks to expert experience and knowledge. However, owing to an increase in the varieties and overall volume of behavioral data, it has become more and more challenging to identify high-quality handcrafted features. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model that automatically extracts features from students’ multi-source heterogeneous behavior data to predict academic performance. The key innovation of this model is that it uses long short-term memory networks to capture inherent time-series features for each type of behavior, and it takes two-dimensional convolutional networks to extract correlation features among different behaviors. We conducted experiments with four types of daily behavior data from students of the university in Beijing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed deep model method outperforms several machine learning algorithms.},

to develop a reference framework for the evaluation of virtual conferences with a software
engineering-based approach. By means of a meta-study, evaluation criteria and corresponding
metrics are defined. A table of sample metrics was also designed to guide the selection
of appropriate metrics. Furthermore, an evaluation criteria fingerprint was created, with
which the characteristics of a virtual conference can be captured at a glance and conveniently
compared with other conferences. Based on these results and a requirements analysis, a corresponding
reference framework was designed and implemented. With this flexibly extendable
tool, virtual conferences can be evaluated on the basis of metrics. As a special feature, custom
metrics can also be defined and added to the dashboard, so that the framework can be used
for generic virtual conferences in the field of computer science.},

A vast catalogue of smells has been defined in the literature, and it includes smells that can be found in any kind of system (e.g., God Classes), regardless of their architecture. On the other hand, software systems adopting specific architectures (e.g., the Model-View-Controller pattern) can be also affected by other types of poor practices. We surveyed and interviewed 53 MVC developers to collect bad practices to avoid while working on Web MVC applications. Then, we followed an open coding procedure on the collected answers to define a catalogue of six Web MVC smells, namely BRAIN REPOSITORY, FAT REPOSITORY, PROMISCUOUS CONTROLLER, BRAIN CONTROLLER, LABORI-OUS REPOSITORY METHOD, and MEDDLING SERVICE. Then, we ran a study on 100 MVC projects to assess the impact of these smells on code change-and defect-proneness. In addition, we surveyed 21 developers to verify their perception of the defined smells. The achieved results show that the Web MVC smells (i) more often than not, increase change-and defect-proneness of classes, and (ii) are perceived by developers as severe problems.},

We believe that future Web applications will retain the Web 2.0 focus on community and usability, while drawing on Semantic Web infrastructure to facilitate mashup-like information sharing. However, there are several open issues that must be addressed before such applications can become commonplace. In this paper, we outline a semantic weblogs scenario that illustrates the potential for combining Web 2.0 and Semantic Web technologies, while highlighting the unresolved issues that impede its realization. Nevertheless, we believe that the scenario can be realized in the short-term.

The pattern defines not only the roles objects play in the application, it defines the way objects communicate with each other. Each of the three types of objects is separated from the others by abstract boundaries and communicates with objects of the other types across those boundaries. The collection of objects of a certain MVC type in an application is sometimes referred to as a layer—for example, model layer. MVC is central to a good design for a Cocoa application. The benefits of adopting this pattern are numerous. Many objects in these applications tend to be more reusable, and their interfaces tend to be better defined. Applications having an MVC design are also more easily extensible than other applications. Moreover, many Cocoa technologies and architectures are based on MVC and require that your custom objects play one of the MVC roles.},

Such syndication templates are edited, published and shared by using a collaborative Web platform. Templates for common types of entities can then be combined with specific, linked data resources or SPARQL query results and integrated into a wide range of applications, such as personal homepages, blogs/wikis, mobile widgets etc. In order to improve reliability and performance of linked data, LESS caches versions either for a certain time span or for the case of inaccessibility of the original source. LESS supports the integration of information from various sources as well as any text-based output formats.

	abstract = {Templates have been used to engage non-expert multimedia authors as content producers. In template-based authoring, templates with most of the relevant application logic and application constraints are developed by experts, who must also specify the template semantics, report which are the required gaps to be filled in, and how to do so. Filling template's gaps is the single task left to inexperienced users to produce the final applications. To do that, they usually must understand the padding instructions reported by template authors and learn some specific padding language. An alternative is using specific GUI components created specifically to each new developed template. This paper proposes a semi-automatic generation of GUI Wizards to guide end(-user) authors to create multimedia applications. The wizard can be tuned to improve the communication between the template author and the template end user, and also if the template specification is not complete. Many successful trial cases show that the generated wizards are usually simple enough to be used by non-experts. The contributions coming from this paper is not constrained to any specific template language or final-application format. Nevertheless, aiming at testing the proposal it was instantiated to work with TAL (Template Authoring Language) whose template processors can generate applications in different target languages.},

RDFa is a vocabulary for adding semantic annotations to standard XHTML and HTML5 documents. This allows the page to contain machine-readable content that is easier to find and mashable with other content. This paper describes Callimachus, an Open Source project that turns this idea around, using RDFa as a template language for the bulk generation of human-readable Web pages from machine-readable RDF data. Most existing template engines generate Web pages by combining the template with query results from a relational database. In the Callimachus template engine, XHTML+RDFa templates pass through an RDFa parser and are then compiled into SPARQL for evaluation against an RDF database. The result set is combined with the template to produce a Web page populated with RDF data, retaining the embedded RDFa. This paper evaluates the benefits and shortcomings of RDFa as a template language, and examines the relationship between Callimachus and the adoption of Web standards such as RDFa.},

The recovered model is then used as a starting point to define a new design for the application, adopting the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern and the Java Server Faces technology.

	abstract = {: J2EE architecture has many complicated layers, including client. These layers are presentation layer, business logic layer and data persistence layer. There is respective data presentation in relevant layer of J2EE, with strictly rules to access and transform data objects between these layers. This paper brings forward middleware technology which is the kernel and key to the solution of the dynamic E- business system through analyzing J2EE architecture and the most important MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern. It includes the component technology of JSP, Servlet and EJB etc. J2EE technology and MVC design pattern can simplify the software development, improve the software performance and quickly construct the dynamic E-business system of the good expansibility, maintainability, dependability and high usability. The traditional system of industry report is highly influenced by the database security and has low efficiency on report. In order to solve these problems, this paper studies J2EE and MVC architecture, combine them and propose an industry report system which based on J2EE and MVC architecture. The system which makes full advantages of both architecture, has solved the problems such as avoid showing databases pattern to client directly and separating the data persistence layer, business logic layer and presentation layer from each other. It obtains a good result in the web based practical application},

	title = {Dynamic {Localization} of {Components} in {Distributed} {Systems}},
	abstract = {The widespread diffusion of the Internet, started in the last decade of the 20th century, has caused a renewed attemption to the research activities on distributed environments. In fact, the interest of the scientific and industrial community in this last years has been oriented towards problems of the resource sharing either hardware and software. In this context, one important issue concerns the localization of resources. For this reason, in this thesis I deal with some problems affecting the discovery systems of four important different areas of distributed computing: Web services, RMI Java technology, distributed Java virtual machines and computational Grid. More precisely, I propose an enhanced UDDI registry providing predictions about the run-time behavior of Web services; its adoption can improve the phase of the dynamic locate and selection of service instances. With respect to the Java RMI technology, I propose the extension of the naming service provided by the RMI registry with a directory service. The proposed framework makes it possible the de- velopment of reliable, performant, and high-available RMI applications. Furthermore, a second framework, able to generate gateway RMI/Web services, is presented. This framework permits a transparent integration of RPC-Web services in RMI based applications. Then, I report on a recently started research activity focusing on the Java thread migration among distributed Java Virtual Machines. I present an implementation of DJVM based on peer-to-peer primitives, able to build large and dynamic JVM farms. In addition, I introduce an ongoing formalization process, which final goal is to extended the Java computational model adding aspects concerning the thread migration issue. Finally, I propose to extend the current Grid Information System (GIS) architecture, with the aim to enhance the discovery, allocation and management of the Grid resources using inferential techniques.},

	volume = {2002-Janua},
	abstract = {Integrating legacy Cobol systems into a Web-based architecture is a complex and challenging task. Cobol is not a distributed and object-oriented language, however its integration with other languages or distributed systems is a prerequisite for achieving migration towards Web technologies. Moreover, the user interface and user interaction modalities need to be changed. Numerous strategies have been proposed for wrapping the business logic and re-implementing the user interface, but there is still a great need for experimental research. This paper presents a migration strategy whose target system is a Web-enabled architecture based on the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. By extracting all the needed information from the Cobol source code, the realized toolkit can automatically generate wrappers for the business logic and the data model and the Web user interface as Java server pages. The strategy and the toolkit presented have been defined within the project M\&S SW, a research project aimed at defining new technological solutions to be transferred to small and medium enterprises operating in information and communication technologies.},

When the application grows in complexity, manual code development is not suitable, because it lacks in efficiency, reuse, reliability, maintainability, and group work facilities. On the other hand, several Web engineering approaches are too far away from the average developer and designer way of working to be widely adopted. In this demonstration paper we propose a light-weight design notation (with its companion editing tool) that leads to the development of MVC applications. We present an on-line visual editing tool called MVC-Webflow for the specification of simple conceptual models for MVC applications and we provide partial automatic code generation, that can be performed on the flight directly on the deployed application. The advantages of the approach are the closeness to the well known MVC paradigm, the foundation on solid web engineering models.},

	abstract = {The design of web applications that adapt to different kinds of devices is now a necessity. The responsive web design (RWD) is an actual approach to this problem. There exists a large quantity of responsive frameworks (RF) for developing RWDs. In particular for the domain of Rich internet applications and for the adaptation of applications to different kinds of devices we have found a few adaptive design approaches that start with abstract user interface (UI) models; however, such approaches did not take into account the use of RFs. The problem of defining a development process from an abstract UI model to a RF is interesting due to some reasons; a good process should consider: an abstract UI model whose elements are abstractions for RF widgets, the use of tools for RFs that generate part of the final UI code, the use of model transformations to map abstract UI elements onto widgets of the RF. In this paper we created an abstract UI model called RIAAD2 that considers abstractions for all the UI elements of a selected set of RFs, and we developed a process for the creation of a final UI using a RF that considers the above requirements.},

	title = {Effects of {Video} {Feedback} {Mode} on {Students} ’ {Academic} {Writing}},
	abstract = {Academic writing is a challenge for students undertaking a degree as they encounter new genres in reading and writing, a new academic register, and referencing. Many researchers have highlighted the importance of feedback for developing students’ academic writing (e.g., K. Hyland, 2009; Poulos \& Mahony, 2008), yet others have shown that feedback is often poor quality or not engaged with by students (Chanock, 2000; Wingate, 2010). Researchers have theorised that the mode of feedback may affect feedback provision and students’ engagement with feedback (Crook et al., 2012; Kerr \& McLaughlin, 2008; Stannard, 2008); however, there is little empirical research that investigates the effects of feedback mode. To address this research gap, this study examines the effect of two different feedback modes, written mode and audio-visual mode, with particular attention to the focus and form of the feedback, as well as students’ revisions in response to the feedback. A mixed method case study design was employed with a purposeful sample of 20 first-year undergraduate students at an Australian higher education institution. Over the course of a term, each student submitted two draft assignments to an academic skills advisor for feedback. One paper received written feedback and the other paper received screen-capture audio-visual feedback, which incorporates spoken recorded feedback and simultaneous video of the advisor’s computer screen. Using grounded theory methods, the analysis involved coding, classifying and organising the advisor’s comments (n = 1040) and the students’ corresponding revisions into an analytical framework to measure and describe the effects of mode on the provision and uptake of feedback. This inductive approach is in the tradition of feedback researchers such as Ferris (1997, 2006) and Merry and Orsmond (2008), but the current study’s framework differs from others as it incorporates a sociocultural theoretical perspective and moves away from viewing comments as corrective feedback in response to language errors only. The student participants were also surveyed and interviewed to gain qualitative data about their perceptions and preferences to help explain the findings of the feedback analysis. The analysis revealed that 88\% of the video comments led students to make a successful revision to their draft compared to 77\% of the written comments. Results show further that written feedback was highly directive and largely focused on linguistic accuracy, whereas video feedback was more likely to address content and text structure issues and contain detailed explanations and praise. Most student stated they prefer video feedback because, in their opinion, it is easier to understand, feels more personal and includes explanations about why changes are necessary and how to improve their work. These findings indicate that the spoken nature of audio-visual feedback can help implement feedback good practice principles, such as those suggested by Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) and Straub (2000), and can also facilitate feedback that aligns with a Vygotskian theoretical orientation (Vygotsky, 1978) to academic language and learning support. The findings also support Mayer’s (2009) claim that a multimodal (e.g. audio and visual) approach to learning is more effective than a mono-modal (e.g. only visual) approach. These insights contribute to the growing body of literature on feedback methods and can inform feedback practice in higher education to support students with the development of their academic writing skills.},

	abstract = {In Web-based information systems, separating business process logic from data and presentation logic creates a wide range of advantages. However, this separation is not easily achieved; even the data logic may be not separated from the presentation layer. Therefore it is necessary to define an abstract model for business processes, and then to map the model into a user's dynamic interface using the logic separating strategy. This paper presents a stylesheet method for recognizing the process by extending the XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) in order to achieve logic separation. This discussion will provide an abstract specification of the business process and a scheme that extracts business model factors and their interactions using a Petri-net notation to show the business model from the process point of view. This is an attempt to separate the user interaction from the business process, that is, the separating of the dynamic components of the interaction Web document from the process structure of the Web applications. As a result, the development of service-oriented Web sites is made very easy and can be changed without affecting the other modules by virtue of the modularization concept. This facilitates development and maintenance of Web applications in independent manner. © 2003 IEEE.},

Many studies focus on analysing cognitive processes and difficulties experienced by web users, but very few are interested in web designers' difficulties or in comparing their respective activities. Towards this end, the two experimental studies presented in this article compare the strategies developed both by professional web designers and (novice vs. experienced) web users while searching for information on web sites of varying ergonomic quality. More precisely, we investigated whether web designers can effectively use their own strategies as web users when designing web sites. We presented a comparison of novice web users, experienced web users and professional web designers searching behavior and cognitive load when using ergonomic and non-ergonomic web sites. In addition, we asked web designers to predict the strategy used by novice web users. Based on the results obtained in the two experiments, we conclude that web designers are not able to predict strategies of novice users and do not behave like novice users. Consequently, ways for supporting web designers in developing a user-centered activity are necessary, and certain ways are suggested at the end of this article. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Web 2.0 is often defined by the technologies that are part of it: social software, Weblogs, linklogs, folksonomies, wikis, podcasts, RSS feeds, and Web services. Because of this, some see Web 2.0 as merely hype. "Web 2.0" is transforming the Web into a space that allows anyone to create and share information online--a space for collaboration, conversation, and interaction; a space that is highly dynamic, flexible, and adaptable. Here, she discusses six pillars of Web 2.0 that they designed as the foundation for rebuilding their library Web site, namely: (1) radical decentralization; (2) small pieces loosely joined; (3) perpetual beta; (4) remixable content; (5) user as contributor; and (6) rich user experience.},

	abstract = {Clustering XML documents by structure is the task of grouping them by common structural components. Hitherto, this has been accomplished by looking at the occurrence of one preestablished type of structural components in the structures of the XML documents. However, the a-priori chosen structural components may not be the most appropriate for effective clustering. Moreover, it is likely that the resulting clusters exhibit a certain extent of inner structural inhomogeneity, because of uncaught differences in the structures of the XML documents, due to further neglected forms of structural components. To overcome these limitations, a new hierarchical approach is proposed, that allows to consider (if necessary) multiple forms of structural components to isolate structurally-homogeneous clusters of XML documents. At each level of the resulting hierarchy, clusters are divided by considering some type of structural components (unaddressed at the preceding levels), that still differentiate the structures of the XML documents. Each cluster in the hierarchy is summarized through a novel technique, that provides a clear and differentiated understanding of its structural properties. A comparative evaluation over both real and synthetic XML data proves that the devised approach outperforms established competitors in effectiveness and scalability. Cluster summarization is also shown to be very representative. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This necessitates flexible system implementations, easily customizable to target domains and associated requirements. An important part of a self-management infrastructure is the self-representation, which models system functionality concerns, allowing their inspection and adaptation. As the range of self-management capabilities expands, the task of creating appropriate self-representations becomes ever more complex. Future self-representations will need to track greater amounts of system information than ever before, and in a way that's flexible, customizable, and portable between system implementations. Meeting these requirements will require a maturing in the design and construction practices for self-representations. The Model-View-Controller design pattern can improve concern separation in a self-representation. This pattern helps encapsulate state, analysis, and realization operations, improving a self-representation's flexibility, customization, and portability.},

A striking consequence of this scale invariance is that the structure of the Web is "fractal"---cohesive subregions display the same characteristics as the Web at large. An understanding of this underlying fractal nature is therefore applicable to designing data services across multiple domains and scales.We describe potential applications of this line of research to optimized algorithm design for Web-scale data analysis.},

	title = {Detecting inconsistencies in distributed data},
	abstract = {One of the central problems for data quality is inconsistency detection. Given a database D and a set ¿ of dependencies as data quality rules, we want to identify tuples in D that violate some rules in ¿. When D is a centralized database, there have been effective SQL-based techniques for finding violations. It is, however, far more challenging when data in D is distributed, in which inconsistency detection often necessarily requires shipping data from one site to another. This paper develops techniques for detecting violations of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) in relations that are fragmented and distributed across different sites. (1) We formulate the detection problem in various distributed settings as optimization problems, measured by either network traffic or response time. (2)We show that it is beyond reach in practice to find optimal detection methods: the detection problem is NP-complete when the data is partitioned either horizontally or vertically, and when we aim to minimize either data shipment or response time. (3) For data that is horizontally partitioned, we provide several algorithms to find violations of a set of CFDs, leveraging the structure of CFDs to reduce data shipment or increase parallelism. (4) We verify experimentally that our algorithms are scalable on large relations and complex CFDs. (5) For data that is vertically partitioned, we provide a characterization for CFDs to be checked locally without requiring data shipment, in terms of dependency preservation. We show that it is intractable to minimally refine a partition and make it dependency preserving.},

Built upon enterprise-class WebSphere software, with added administrative and scalability features, It contains the widest range of portal technologies that help you develop and maintain first-class B2C, B2B and B2E portals and offers a complete set of portal services necessary to aggregate applications and content, such as: • Advanced usability features, as such drag \& drop customizations and semantic tags that enable smart mark-ups and dynamic menus • Advanced tooling needed to build flexible, SOA-based solutions with unmatched scalability required by any size organization. • A "one click" site management application featuring rollback and versioning capabilities to simplify moving portals from staging to production • A Page Builder that simplifies page creation, making it easy for business users to create pages and add content to pages • A site wizard that allows users to create and deploy independent virtual portals • A Template Page capability that speeds page creation by allowing portal pages to act as templates when creating other new portal pages • A Web application integrator that enables you to easily embed existing Web applications into your portals • Blog and Wiki capabilities supported via out-of-box content templates, making it easy to add popular social capabilities • Enhanced tagging and rating within the Page Builder theme, allowing users to easily organize and evaluate content without leaving the page they are viewing • Flexible access to existing enterprise data and applications, as well as to external news feeds or Web data • Unified user experience in which information and functions made available to each user can be customized based on the user or a role that the user has • Support for the Java Portlet 2.0 Standard and to the first Java Portlet Specification, the Java Portlet 1.0 Standard. • Support for Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) 2.0 • Site layout support that enables you to incorporate existing static HTML, built with familiar HTML and PHP development tools, opening up the platform to additional content sources On the other hand, there is no doubt that Spring is the most complete lightweight Java/JEE container that is used widely in Java development software workshops. With a powerful dependency injection engine at its core and established software engineering practices such as interface-oriented design and Aspect oriented programming, Spring combines the enterprise application power with the simplicity of plain-old Java objects to bring about increased productivity and ease of testing. The Spring Portlet "Model View Controller" framework is a truly unique one compared to other frameworks because it is exclusively designed for developing portlets, leaving behind the limitation(s) that comes with providing portlet development support in an existing web framework. A web framework is based on servlet technology, which doesn't have a concept of lifecycle phases; therefore it ends up hiding the different lifecycle phases of a portlet. But, with Spring Portler "Model View Controller" framework you get a full featured Portlet Framework which preserves the lifecycle phases of Portlet With Data access being the requirement for most enterprise applications, Spring provides not only JDBC abstraction framework but also integration with "Object Relational Mapping" (ORM) Solutions such as Java Data Objects (JDO), Hibernate and Java Persistence API (JPA) on a variety of Platforms including WebSphere Application Server. With Transactions coupled tightly with Data access, Spring provides an abstract layer on top of different transactions management APIs both declaratively and programmatically. As an application developer, you can use Spring's transactions management facilities without having to know much out the underlying transaction management APIs. Combining two of the best solutions (WebSphere Portal and Spring), that are not only based on but also promote software engineering best practices, provides software practitioners with an exceptional opportunity to focus on the problem at hand and to have their development cycle reduced considerably.},

In most of these applications the web browser acts as thin-client (or a view) of the model that sits on the server. Despite the technological evolution of the web, there is still no standard mechanism to send data or events from the server to the client without an explicit request from the later, thus forcing the web browser to constantly poll the server for updates. To solve this problem a set of techniques under the name of Comet were proposed, allowing to send information from the server to the web browser without an explicit client request. In this paper we introduce Meteoroid, a Comet approach to make "live" Seaside applications. Our framework exploits the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm for building simple yet scalable web applications, requiring very little programming effort. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, inde-pendent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. In this article we introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture and used to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the inter-action constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architec-ture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.},

	issn = {00010782},
	doi = {10.1145/1839676.1839701},
	abstract = {Though computer scientists agree that conference publications enjoy greater status in computer science than in other disciplines, there is little quantitative evidence to support this view. The importance of journal publication in academic promotion makes it a highly personal issue, since focusing exclusively on journal papers misses many significant papers published by CS conferences. Here, we aim to quantify the relative importance of CS journal and conference papers, showing that CS papers in leading conferences match the impact of papers in mid-ranking journals and surpass the impact of papers in journals in the bottom half of the Thompson Reuters rankings (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for impact measured in terms of citations in Google Scholar. We also show that poor correlation between this measure and conference acceptance rates indicates conference publication is an inefficient market where venues equally challenging in terms of rejection rates offer quite different returns in terms of citations. How to measure the quality of academic research and performance of particular researchers has always involved debate. Many CS researchers feel that performance assessment is an exercise in futility, in part because academic research cannot be boiled down to a set of simple performance metrics, and any attempt to introduce them would expose the entire research enterprise to manipulation and gaming. On the other hand, many researchers want some reasonable way to evaluate academic performance, arguing that even an imperfect system sheds light on research quality, helping funding agencies and tenure committees make more informed decisions. One long-standing way of evaluating academic performance is through publication output. Best practice for academics is to write key research contributions as scholarly articles for submission to relevant journals and conferences; the peer-review model has stood the test of time in determining the quality of accepted articles. However, today's culture of academic publication accommodates a range of publication opportunities yielding a continuum of quality, with a significant gap between the lower and upper reaches of the continuum; for example, journal papers are routinely viewed as superior to conference papers, which are generally considered superior to papers at workshops and local symposia. Several techniques are used for evaluating publications and publication outlets, mostly targeting journals. For example, Thompson Reuters (the Institute for Scientific Information) and other such organizations record and assess the number of citations accumulated by leading journals (and some high-ranking conferences) in the ISI Web of Knowledge (http://www.isiknowledge.com) to compute the impact factor of a journal as a measure of its ability to attract citations. Less-reliable indicators of publication quality are also available for judging conference quality; for example, a conference's rejection rate is often cited as a quality indicator on the grounds that a high rejection rate means a more selective review process able to generate higher-quality papers. However, as the devil is in the details, the details in this case vary among academic disciplines and subdisciplines. Here, we examine the issue of publication quality from a CS/engineering perspective, describing how related publication practices differ from those of other disciplines, in that CS/engineering research is mainly published in conferences rather than in journals. This culture presents an important challenge when evaluating CS research because traditional impact metrics are better suited to evaluating journal rather than conference publications. In order to legitimize the role of conference papers to the wider scientific community, we offer an impact measure based on an analysis of Google Scholar citation data suited to CS conferences. We validate this new measure with a large-scale experiment covering 8,764 conference and journal papers to demonstrate a strong correlation between traditional journal impact and our new citation score. The results highlight how leading conferences compare favorably to mid-ranking journals, surpassing the impact of journals in the bottom half of the traditional ISI Web of Knowledge ranking. We also discuss a number of interesting anomalies in the CS conference circuit, highlighting how conferences with similar rejection rates (the traditional way of evaluating conferences) can attract quite different citation counts. We also note interesting geographical distinctions in this regard, particularly with respect to European and U.S. conferences.},

	abstract = {Clustering XML documents is extensively used to organize large collections of XML documents in groups that are coherent according to structure and/or content features. The growing availability of distributed XML sources and the variety of high-demand environments raise the need for clustering approaches that can exploit distributed processing techniques. Nevertheless, existing methods for clustering XML documents are designed to work in a centralized way. In this paper, we address the problem of clustering XML documents in a collaborative distributed framework. XML documents are first decomposed based on semantically cohesive subtrees, then modeled as transactional data that embed both XML structure and content information. The proposed clustering framework employs a centroid-based partitional clustering method that has been developed for a peer-to-peer network. Each peer in the network is allowed to compute a local clustering solution over its own data, and to exchange its cluster representatives with other peers. The exchanged representatives are used to compute representatives for the global clustering solution in a collaborative way. We evaluated effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on real XML document collections varying the number of peers. Results have shown that major advantages with respect to the corresponding centralized clustering setting are obtained in terms of runtime behavior, although clustering solutions can still be accurate with a moderately low number of nodes in the network. Moreover, the collaborativeness characteristic of our approach has revealed to be a convenient feature in distributed clustering as found in a comparative evaluation with a distributed non-collaborative clustering method. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Mobile web users face a big problem that the majority of web content are tailored for desktop computers which can have a large display area and high connection speed compared with mobile devices which have smaller display area and limited connection bandwidth. So we have to take in our considerations the severe resource constraints on the mobile devices, their performance is usually much lower, smaller processor memory, their screens are smaller, and generally their internet connections are much slower, power, form factor, bandwidth and battery. Our proposed smart framework for web content and resources adaptation in mobile devices (WRAMD) intend to provide a majestic tool for webmasters that could weaves both mobile web and traditional web production into just one single tool. This will help them to facilitate the web content production for both desktop and mobile web users, and will move the world into faster and simpler mobile web site development, with light weight transfer over a wireless channel. Our target is to provide the best web view to the connected mobile devices, enhance the http response, give a minimized bandwidth usage for mobile access and provide a device specific view for connected mobile device.},

	abstract = {Template languages are widely used within generative programming, because they provide intuitive means to generate software artefacts expressed in a specific object language. However, most template languages perform template instantiation on the level of string literals, which allows neither syntax checks nor semantics analysis. To make sure that generated artefacts always conform to the object language, we propose to perform static analysis at template design time. In addition, the increasing popularity of domain-specific languages (DSLs) demands an approach that allows to reuse both the concepts of template languages and the corresponding tools. In this paper we address the issues mentioned above by presenting how existing languages can be automatically extended with generic template concepts (e.g., placeholders, loops, conditions) to obtain safe template languages. These languages provide means for syntax checking and static semantic analysis w.r.t. the object language at template design time. We discuss the prerequisites for this extension, analyse the types of correctness properties that can be assured at template design time, and exemplify the key benefits of this approach on a textual DSL and Java.

	title = {Data binding for standard-based web applications},
	abstract = {Development frameworks have proven to drive developer productivity and flourish in a variety of different application domains. For example, data binding frameworks supporting the process of associating User Interface (UI) elements and data objects can reduce implementation efforts significantly. Even so desktop application developers have access to amyr- iad of data binding frameworks (e.g. Eclipse JFace); Web development still lacks decent data binding framework sup- port. Therefore, we devised a WebSocket-based Data-binding (WebSoDa) framework which is capable of easing the cum- bersome and error-prone task of coupling UI elements with their respective data objects. Besides providing aMicrodata- based data binding language, the WebSoDa framework em- braces the WebSocket protocol. We show that the network traffic in data binding scenarios can decrease considerably by applying aWebSocket-based framework instead of a con- ventional AJAX approach.},

In Web 2.0 applications, much of that effect is delivered through social linkages realized via social networks online. Unfortunately, the associated semantics for Web 2.0 applications, delivered through tagging, is generally minimally hierarchical and sparsely linked. The Semantic Web suffers from the opposite problem. Semantic information, delivered through ontologies of varying amounts of expressivity, is linked to other terms (within or between resources) creating a link space in the semantic realm. However, the use of the Semantic Web has yet to fully realize the social schemes that provide the network of users. In this article, we discuss putting these together, with linked semantics coupled to linked social networks, to deliver a much greater effect. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Information systems are supporting professionals in all areas of e-Business. In this paper we concentrate on our experiences in the design and development of information systems for the use in film production processes. Professionals working in this area are neither computer experts, nor interested in spending much time for information systems. Consequently, to provide a useful, useable and enjoyable application the system must be extremely suited to the requirements and demands of those professionals. One of the most important tasks at the beginning of a film production is to break down the movie script into its elements and aspects, and create a solid estimate of production costs based on the resulting breakdown data. Several film production software applications provide interfaces to support this task. However, most attempts suffer from numerous usability deficiencies. As a result, many film producers still use script printouts and textmarkers to highlight script elements, and transfer the data manually into their film management software. This paper presents a novel approach for unobtrusive and efficient script breakdown using a new way of breaking down text into its relevant elements. We demonstrate how the implementation of this interface benefits from employing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) as underlying software design paradigm in terms of both software development confidence and user satisfaction.},

In this paper, we propose WAPDB, a distributed database management system for the rapid development of Web applications. WAPDB is designed on Atom, a set of Web API standards, and provides several of the key features required for Web applications, including efficient access control, an easy extension mechanism, and search and statistics capabilities. By introducing WAPDB, developers are freed from the need to implement these features as well as Web API processing. In addition, its design totally follows the REST architectural style, which gives uniformity and scalability to applications. We develop a proof-of-concept application with WAPDB, and find that it offers great cost effectiveness with no significant impact on performance; in our experiments, the development cost is reduced to less than half with the overhead (in use) of response times of just a few msec.

	abstract = {Managing the performance of multiple-tiered Web sites under high client loads is a critical problem with the advent of dynamic content and database-driven servers on the Internet. This paper presents a control-theoretic approach for admission control in multi-tieredWeb sites that both prevents overload and enforces absolute client response times, while still maintaining high throughput under load. We use classical control theoretic techniques to design a Proportional Integral (PI) controller for admission control of client HTTP requests. In addition, we present a processor-sharing model that is used to make the controller self-tuning, so that no parameter setting is required beyond a target response time. Our controller is implemented as a proxy, called Yaksha,which operates by taking simple external measurements of the client response times. Our design is non-invasive and requires minimal operator intervention.We evaluate our techniques experimentally using a 3-tiered dynamic contentWeb site as a testbed. Using the industry standard TPC-W client workload generator, we study the performance of the PI admission controller with extensive experiments. We show that the controller effectively bounds the response times of requests for dynamic content while still maintaining high throughput levels, even when the client request rate is many times that of the server’s maximum processing rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-tuning mechanism, showing that it responds and adapts smoothly to changes in the workload.},

	abstract = {Recently, enterprises, organizations, and software companies are building more and more web applications to provide their services over the Internet. In order to fulfill various requirements, the complexity of web applications nowadays is increasing dramatically. As a result, the performance characteristics of web applications, including response time, throughput, etc, become more critical than before and should be taken into careful consideration. If the response time of a web application is poor, users may lose their interests even the function of the web application is correct. Therefore, how to execute performance testing on a complex web application systematically and efficiently will be an important issue. In this paper, a performance testing framework for REST-based web applications is introduced. The performance testing framework aims to provide software testers with an integrated process from test cases design, test scripts generation, to test execution. Based on the test cases designed by software testers and the appropriate software artifacts preserved by the framework (e.g., API document), the framework generates the corresponding performance test scripts, which can be executed by specific performance test tools. This helps software testers to focus more in the design of performance test cases. In addition, effort needed to understand the design and implementation of the application and to learn the operation of testing tools decrease. Thus, the efficiency of performance testing can be highly facilitated.},

In order to achieve high productivity of publishing, the webpages in many websites are automatically populated by using the common templates with contents. The templates provide readers easy access to the contents guided by consistent structures.

Thus, template detection techniques have received a lot of attention recently to improve the performance of search engines, clustering, and classification of web documents. In this paper, we present novel algorithms for extracting templates from a large number of web documents which are generated from heterogeneous templates. We cluster the web documents based on the similarity of underlying template structures in the documents so that the template for each cluster is extracted simultaneously. We develop a novel goodness measure with its fast approximation for clustering and provide comprehensive analysis of our algorithm. Our experimental results with real-life data sets confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm compared to the state of the art for template detection algorithms.},

	title = {{JScaffold}: {A} {Rapid} {Application} {Development} {Solution} for {Java} {MVC} {Applications}},
	abstract = {Rapid application development (RAD) is used to save time in the development process of new applications. While RAD can be used for a variety of applications, it is especially useful in database-driven applications designed on a large scale, where repetitive code can severely lengthen the development time of the project. The effectiveness of a RAD tool can be affected by architectural factors, such as programming languages and frameworks. This thesis describes a Java framework known as Spring and explains how Spring is well suited for RAD. Spring is a popular extension to Java Enterprise Edition, a framework for developing multi-tier, distributed applications. Its simplicity leads to faster development of software applications, and easier integration with RAD and other tools. Scaffolding is a process in which data is exposed and manipulated by HTTP clients in a distributed, networked environment. Spring is complemented by an existing RAD tool named Roo, which is able to generate scaffolded applications with fully-functional web interfaces and database-driven classes that can be modified to suit the domain in which they operate. Roo's most prominent setback is the lack of a graphical user interface. Without it, Roo is less likely to attract new developers, more likely to slow the development processes, and more likely to produce error conditions that are difficult to correct. This thesis presents a software application, named JScaffold, that addresses this and several other problems in Roo, and provides an enhanced user experience where users can be comfortable in developing their applications. The results of JScaffold, supported by several developers familiar with database-driven applications, show that this software tool can improve the usability of the Roo tool, making Spring and Java a more attractive platform for RAD. Its functionality resembles the features of other RAD tools which generate scaffolded applications. The results show that with JScaffold, Spring-based RAD becomes more effective and attractive for application developers.},

	abstract = {Web application development cuts across the \{HTTP\} protocol, the client-side presentation language (\{HTML\}, \{XML\}), the server-side technology (Servlets, \{JSP\}, \{ASP\}, \{PHP\}), and the underlying resource (files, database, information system). Consequently, web development concerns including functionality, presentation, control, and structure cross-cut, leading to tangled and scattered code that is hard to develop, maintain, and reuse. In this paper we analyze the cause, consequence, and remedy for this crosscutting. We distinguish between intra-crosscutting that results in code tangling and inter-crosscutting that results in code scattering. To resolve inter-crosscutting, we present a new web application development model named \{XP\} that introduces extension points as place-holders for structure-dependent code. We present another model named \{DDD\} that incorporates \{XP\} into the Model-View-Controller (\{MVC\}) model to resolve both intra- and inter-crosscutting. \{WebJinn\} is a novel domain-driven web development framework that implements the \{DDD\} model. \{WebJinn\} has been used to develop web applications at several web sites. Domain driven web development with \{WebJinn\} benefits from a significant improvement in code reuse, adaptability, and maintainability.},

This is often a large, complex Web site that is difficult to understand and maintain. Here, we propose an approach that aims to restructure an existing Web site by adapting them to a controller-centric architecture. In particular, this approach is twofold. First, it defines a domain model to represent dependencies between Web pages in order to abstract current structure of the Web site. Second, it designs a system architecture as a reference model for restructuring the Web site to the new structure. These principles will be illustrated through a case study using a reengineering tool that implements the refactoring process for a JSP-based Web site.},

One particularly challenging domain of semiconductor manufacturing is testing, an increasingly expensive endeavor due to the costly automated test equipment required. In response, industrial groups are actively developing means of dynamically modifying test programs to more efficiently test hardware, via an approach known as adaptive test. The deployment of such adaptive test systems can be quite challenging due to the many requirements placed on the system, including the ability to rapidly process data from millions of devices, ease of integrating novel adaptive test techniques, and ability to permit test engineers to easily monitor the system. These test challenges hint at broader data stratification challenges facing semiconductor manufacturing. In this work we motivate the need for bringing modern compute methods to bear on semiconductor manufacturing, and particularly adaptive test, via the software architecture known as model-view-controller, a pattern that is already widely used in software engineering.},

Applying the Model/View/Controller design pattern to web-applications is therefore complicated by the fact that current technologies encourage developers to partition the application as early as in the design phase. Subsequent changes to that partitioning require considerable changes to the application's implementation-despite the fact that the application logic has not changed. This paper introduces the concept of Flexible Web-Application Partitioning, a programming model and implementation infrastructure, that allows developers to apply the Model/View/Controller design pattern in a partition-independent manner Applications are developed and tested in a single address-space; they can then be deployed to various client/server architectures without changing the application's source code. In addition, partitioning decisions can be changed without modifying the application},

An agent, which is an autonomous entity that acts on behalf of the user, has different properties than objects. For example, objects are passive entities that react to external stimuli, but do not exhibit goal directed behavior. On the other hand, agents are active entities that may learn about their environment and react to changes. Because of such crucial differences between objects and agents, object-oriented analysis and design methods cannot accommodate the requirements of engineering agent-based systems. Agents, however, can learn a few things from object-oriented analysis and design.

	doi = {10.1145/2593489.2593495},
	abstract = {The involvement of formal methods is indispensable for modern software engineering. This especially holds for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In order to deal with the complexity and heterogeneity of the design, model-based engineering is widely used. The complexity of detailed verification in the final source code makes it imperative to introduce formal methods earlier in the design process. Because of the widespread use of customized modeling languages (domain-specific modeling languages, DSMLs), it is crucial to formally specify the DSML, and verify if the model meets fundamental correctness criteria. This is achieved by specifying behavioral and structural semantics of the modeling language. Significant model-driven tools have emerged incorporating advanced model checking methods that can provide some assurance regarding the quality and correctness of the models. However, the code generated from these models, using auto code generators remains circumspect, since the correctness of the code generators cannot be assumed as a given, and remains intractable to prove. Therefore, we propose a pragmatic approach, instead of verifying explicit implementation of code generator, verifies the correctness of the generated code with respect to a specific set of user-defined properties to establish that the code-generators are property-preserving. In order to make the verification workflow conducive to domain engineers, who are not often trained in formal methods, we include a mechanism for high-level specification of temporal properties using pattern-based verification templates. The presented toolchain leverages state-of-the-art verification tools, and a small case-study illustrates the approach. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

It is highly challenging to detect plugin conflicts due to the exponential explosion of the combinations of plugins (i.e., configurations). In this paper, we address the challenge of executing a test case over many configurations. Leveraging the fact that many executions of a test are similar, our variability-aware execution runs common code once. Only when encountering values that are different depending on specific configurations will the execution split to run for each of them. To evaluate the scalability of variability-aware execution on a large real-world setting, we built a prototype PHP interpreter called Varex and ran it on the popular WordPress blogging Web application. The results show that while plugin interactions exist, there is a significant amount of sharing that allows variability-aware execution to scale to 2{\textasciicircum}50 configurations within seven minutes of running time. During our study, with Varex, we were able to detect two plugin conflicts: one was recently reported on WordPress forum and another one was not previously discovered.},

While as has been semi-structured, XML data has to be parsed before being processed at both the client and the server sides. Applications show that the parsing process of XML is quilt time and memory consuming, such as DOM needs to load the whole XML document into memory before processing the data. Compared with XML, JSON is a light-weight key-value style data exchanging format. As we know, the efficiency of mapping data between different data models is the key point to improve the performance of web service applications. In this work, a data model mapping approach, named as Dynamic Advanced Binding (DAB), is proposed for processing JSON data. This approach efficiently maps the JSON data onto the host language (such as Java) by dynamically building the Data Mapping Template (DMT) during the runtime. The DMTs are specified by extending context-free grammar and implemented with a pushdown automaton with output. The experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed approach. © 2011 by Binary Information Press.},

In this paper, we discuss the support for achieving quality attributes for the Web-application, the support for Web-application development process and the support for meeting demanding features of Web application on Java EE platform. This contribution will help a lot for small scale as well as large scale Web-application development and for moulding Web-application into a future's high quality finished product from inception phase itself.},

This HOWTO describes some of the methods used to combine Python with a web server to create dynamic content.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nThe Web Server Gateway Interface, or WSGI for short, is defined in PEP 333 and is currently the best way to do Python web programming. While it is great for programmers writing frameworks, a normal web developer does not need to get in direct contact with it. When choosing a framework for web development it is a good idea to choose one which supports WSGI.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nOriginally Python web frameworks tended to incorporate all of the services needed to develop web sites as a giant, integrated set of tools. No two web frameworks were interoperable: a program developed for one could not be deployed on a different one without considerable re-engineering work. This led to the development of “minimalist” web frameworks that provided just the tools to communicate between the Python code and the http protocol, with all other services to be added on top via separate components. Some ad hoc standards were developed that allowed for limited interoperability between frameworks, such as a standard that allowed different template engines to be used interchangeably.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nSince the advent of WSGI, the Python web framework world has been evolving toward interoperability based on the WSGI standard.

The ASP.NET MVC Framework is the evolution of Microsoft's ASP.NET web platform. It introduced a radical high-productivity programming model that promotes cleaner code architecture, test-driven development, and powerful extensibility, combined with all the benefits of ASP.NET 3.5. An integral benefit of this book is that the core Model-View-Controller architectural concepts are not simply explained or discussed in isolation, but demonstrated in action. You'll work through an extended tutorial to create a working e-commerce web application that combines ASP.NET MVC with the latest C\# 3.0 language features and unit-testing best practices.

These specifications offer unmatched flexibility. However, this presents a challenge for ensuring correctness, as each implementation is potentially unique--conformance tests are needed. We propose a generalized methodology and a tool that produces self-adapting test messages. The messages are dynamically created after design-time and factor in unique characteristics of an implementation. This contrasts to traditional methodologies, where tests are developed irrespective of any specific implementation. We demonstrate the utility of our methodology by implementing a tool, called Message Maker, which dynamically produces conformance test messages. Our target test domain is the HL7 version 2 healthcare messaging standard. Message Maker is a graphical-based tool that generates test messages based on any given HL7 XML message template, referred to as a message profile. The resulting messages can be used to test HL7 applications to ensure that they adhere to the message profile specification. Employing a comprehensive testing program at the onset of an implementation leads to more reliable systems, and ultimately, reduced costs.},

The proposed algorithm evolves HTML files for the content and CSS style sheets for a presentation format. Users can rate each section of a web page template according to their preferences. The given scores feed back to the system and the generated template is evolved. The experiments are conducted by assuming user's preferential criteria. We designed score-rules to test the algorithm whether it can create web page templates to satisfy the criteria or not.

The pattern works well in the case of single-address space and not proven to be efficient for web applications involving multiple address spaces. Web applications force the designers to decide which of the components of the pattern are to be partitioned between the server and client(s) before the design phase commences. For any rapidly growing web application, it is very difficult to incorporate future changes in policies related to partitioning. One solution to this problem is to duplicate the Model and controller components at both server and client(s). However, this may add further problems like delayed data fetch, security and scalability issues. In order to overcome this, a new architecture SPIM has been proposed that deals with the partitioning problem in an alternative way. SPIM shows tremendous improvements in performance when compared with a similar architecture.},

	abstract = {Command-oriented functional programs are currently structured in an ad hoc way that makes the development of multiple user-interfaces difficult and error prone, and makes it difficult to abstractly understand a program's command-oriented behavior. To rectify this, we propose a software architecture for such programs that we call functional model-view-controller (MVC), by a rough analogy with object-oriented MVC. In functional MVC, a program is structured as a model (domain-specific aspects), view (abstract user) and controller (command loops). In contrast to object-oriented MVC, a controller is active, consisting of a number of recursive functions. It calls its view to get user input and to display results to the user; it calls its model to do domain-specific work. To increase adaptability, a controller should be parameterized by its model and view, using a function or an ML-style functor. With this approach, one can write terminal and graphical views; one can also write views that do abstract scripting. One can understand and reason about a program's command-oriented aspects at a high-level of abstraction by focusing on the controller. Of particular note is the way we are able to allow computations of the model to be monitored and aborted by view. We illustrate our approach with a case study of a complete program, written in Standard ML. and using Concurrent ML and the eXene X window system toolkit. Copyright \&copy; 2008 ACM.},

MVC separates the representation of the application domain (Model) from the display of the application's state (View) and user interaction control (Controller). However, studying the literature reveals that a variety of other related patterns exists, which we denote with Model-View- (MV) design patterns. This paper discusses existing MV patterns classified in three main families: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-View Model (MVVM), and Model-View-Presenter (MVP). We take a practitioners' point of view and emphasize the essentials of each family as well as the differences. The study shows that the selection of patterns should take into account the use cases and quality requirements at hand, and chosen technology. We illustrate the selection of a pattern with an example of our practice. The study results aim to bring more clarity in the variety of MV design patterns and help practitioners to make better grounded decisions when selecting patterns.},

We describe a simple procedure to implement personalized-as opposed to generically worded-questionnaires in the context of a complex web-based survey of corresponding authors of a random sample of 300 published cluster randomized trials. The purpose of the survey was to gather more detailed information about informed consent procedures used in the trial, over and above basic information provided in the trial report. We describe our approach-which allowed extensive personalization without the need for specialized computer technology-and discuss its potential application in similar settings., RESULTS: The mail merge feature of standard word processing software was used to generate unique, personalized questionnaires for each author by incorporating specific information from the article, including naming the randomization unit (e.g., family practice, school, worksite), and identifying specific individuals who may have been considered research participants at the cluster level (family doctors, teachers, employers) and individual level (patients, students, employees) in questions regarding informed consent procedures in the trial. The response rate was relatively high (64\%, 182/285) and did not vary significantly by author, publication, or study characteristics. The refusal rate was low (7\%)., CONCLUSION: While controlled studies are required to examine the specific effects of our approach on comprehension, quality of responses, and response rates, we showed how mail merge can be used as a simple but useful tool to add personalized fields to complex survey questionnaires, or to request additional information required from study authors. One potential application is in eliciting specific information about published articles from study authors when conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

	abstract = {Web component-based development is a challenging development paradigm, whose attraction to practitioners is increasing more and more. One of the main advantages of this paradigm is the ability to build customizable and composable web application modules as independent units of development, and to share them with other developers by publishing them in libraries as COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) or free components. In parallel, since many years, Web services confirmed their status of one of the most pertinent solutions for a service provider, like Google or Amazon, to open its solutions for third party development. In this paper, we present an approach to migrate existing web component-based applications to a set of primitive and composite Web services and deploy them on a web service provider. This transformation helps server-side web application developers in transforming their "user interface"-based web components into a set of web services intended for remote code extensions. We implemented our solution on a collection of Java-related technologies. Java EE components are the input of the proposed implementation, and a set of Java Web services with their WSDL interfaces, choreographies and orchestrations of these services are provided at output. © 2012 IEEE.},

This article focuses on the implementation of two artifacts of this method: 1) the DSL ASTM\_PHP, a modeling language for defining a model from PHP code (ASTM\_PHP model) and 2) the model-to-model transformation rules which generate automatically a KDM model from a ASTM\_PHP model. To show the feasibility of this implementation, we use a case study based on a widget implemented in PHP which lists the online users of a Web application.},

This paper addresses designing an effective prototype tool that dynamically generates sub-webs of information from a web-based resource (World Wide Web or a subset). Sub-webs present context-relevant results to individuals or groups. Given that the prototype tool is technically implemented from multiple components, each of which has efficacy, there still remains the challenge of devising an appropriate evaluation of the complete model. This is difficult when the search scope is the entire World Wide Web and a vast number of result pages are technically good on Recall but low on Precision. This paper describes an iterative approach to finding an effec- tive technical prototype using an evaluation method that can a) reasonably model the search environment of the World Wide Web and b) provide convinc- ing metrics for evaluating efficacy of solutions.},

Combination of specialization and turnover can cause parts of the system implemented in a certain programming language to become unmaintainable, if knowledge of that language has disappeared together with the retiring developers. Inspired by measures of linguistic diversity from the study of natural languages, we propose a method to quantify the risk of not having maintainers for code implemented in a certain programming language. To illustrate our approach, we studied risks associated with different languages in Emacs, and found examples of low risk due to high popularity (e.g., C, Emacs Lisp); low risk due to similarity with popular languages (e.g., C++, Java, Python); or high risk due to both low popularity and low similarity with popular languages (e.g., Lex).

In contrast to its untyped imple- mentation in Smalltalk, any implementation in a statically typed language involves certain trade-offs which either blur the clear structure, destroy the intended independence, or • introduce undue administrative overhead. Each alternative creates a different caricature of the originally crisp archi- tecture. The programming model Object Teams provides a new modeling unit called Team plus a number of binding mechanisms by which a Team and its contained roles can be bound to existing parts of an application. It turns out that these mechanisms fit nicely for implementing a clear model- view-controller design not only for single elements but also for complex structures of GUI elements plus their binding to complex model structures. We furthermore propose to use the model-view-controller paradigm as a benchmark for AOSD approaches, since it combines a set of typical prob- lems concerning the separation and integration of concerns.},

In the proposed platform, we define the program flow by the business process, which can organize a program process efficiently and flexibly. Since the design of the user interface (UI) is independent of the business process, the developers can design the UI without considering the business process. Furthermore, a novel declarative programming language is proposed to describe the interactions among the components in the web pages as well as define the communication between the web pages and business process, leading to a simple, efficient, and flexible platform for the web application development. The implementation of the real web application example demonstrates the practical applicability and efficacy of the proposed platform. © 2014 IEEE.},

These can be classified into two parts; one that an end user can define and the other that an end user cannot. Using the definition items in these two parts, an operational model for co-developing is proposed, and the procedures for co-development are shown. A collaboration model that can be developed by a user and a system engineer is proposed; then, based on the proposed model, a tool supporting co-developing is built.},

However, it does not explicitly provide the behavioral aspect for the development process of web applications, since the model only defines the static architectural configuration of the components, this fact results in the broad gap between the description of the web application and its behavioral property. We provide a behavioral model for web applications aiming at filling in the gap. The behavior of a web application is modeled by an automaton that accepts the sequences of URLs requested to the application. Next, we propose a testing framework for web applications based on the behavioral model. We show it provides testing criteria for web applications when we focus on the loops on the behavior automata. Finally, we apply our framework to the Jakarta Struts by presenting the extended configuration schema of Struts. It is shown that our behavioral model is useful to categorize testing paths of web applications. We expected the simplest testing criterion covers most of the important cases leading to a efficient testing technique for web applications.},

We propose a language and a number of DSLs for DSL-based design and development that combine important benefits of different DSL toolkits in a unique way. Our approach specifically targets at deferring architectural decisions in DSL-based design. As a consequence, the architect can choose, even late in a DSL project, for options such as whether to provide the DSL as one or more external or embedded DSLs and whether to use an explicit language model or not . ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Recent work in computing suggests that Peer Instruction (PI) is a valuable interactive learning pedagogy: it lowers fail rates, increases retention, and is enjoyed by students and in-structors alike. While these findings are promising, they are somewhat incidental if our goal is to understand whether PI is " better " than lecture in terms of student outcomes. Only one recent study in computing has made such a com-parison, finding that PI students outperform traditionally-taught students on a CS0 final exam. That work was con-ducted in a CS0, where the same instructor taught both courses, and where the only outcome measure was final exam grade. Here, I offer a study that complements their work in two ways. First, I argue for and measure self-efficacy as a valued outcome, in addition to that of final exam grade. Sec-ond, I offer an inter-instructor CS1 study, whose biases differ from those of intra-instructor studies. I find evidence that PI significantly increases self-efficacy and suggestively in-creases exam scores compared to a traditional lecture-based CS1 class. I note validity concerns of such an in-situ study and offer a synthesis of this work with the extant PI litera-ture.},

In response, educators throughout the Western world have generated large quantities of evidence-based, practical, often uncritical research about what works to improve teaching, learning and student success. Much of this research carries the label student engagement. But student engagement is a complex construct used to identify what students do, think and feel when learning and how teachers can improve that doing, thinking and feeling in instructional settings. Despite its extensive coverage of learning and teaching, the paper asks whether something is missing from student engagement. It recognizes the complexity of the engagement construct and examines its key ideas but identifies three missing elements: critique; learning agency/democracy; as well as purposes, knowledge and values that transcend powerful political discourses in neo-liberal times.},

The results of the analysis were interpreted using descriptive analysis, percentages, and frequencies. This analysis found that various fields were practiced in the flipped classroom approach, and some technology tools were used as the online platform for its practice. Analysis of the impacts showed that flipped classroom brought positive impacts toward students' learning activities such as achievement, motivation, engagement, and interaction. Several issues in this discussion become implications that can be taken into consideration for future research. Some challenges found in applying flipped classroom are needed to be addressed by future researchers, such as suitability of the flipped classroom for poor quality of video lectures and untrained instructor. This study also becomes an implication for government or policymakers to determine the flipped classroom as a contemporary model to be implemented in teaching-learning activities for higher education, even K-12 students.},

Other professors ask laptop users to sit in the front row, in part so the professors can glance down occasionally to see what is on the students' screens. A few colleges have set up systems that let professors switch off classroom Internet access during some sessions. Many students dislike the restrictions, arguing that multitasking can balance Internet use and classroom participation. Even some professors think that banning laptops is wrong, and that students need to learn for themselves how to juggle online and offline worlds, since students are likely to carry those same laptops into corporate environments in the future. Attempting to use technology to help find a middle ground, officials at Bentley College, Waltham, Massachusetts set up an on/off switch for Internet access in each classroom. Called the "classroom network control system," it allows professors in many classrooms to choose one of five settings: turn off Internet access but allow e-mail access, turn off e-mail access but allow Internet access, disable Internet and e-mail access but allow computers to reach campus Web pages, shut off all access, or allow all access. A computer at the front of the classroom lets the professor change the settings at any time. INSET: Walling Out Wireless Networks Is No Easy Task.},

The question is less asked of whether games should be used in teaching but rather how games should be used to create deep learning in students.

This case study tackles the research question of how games may be designed to harness the benefits of constructivist learning. It first documents the conceptualization of GIGAME and next proposes theoretical frameworks that can be used to guide the development and evaluation of constructivist learning games. Through trial runs on two undergraduate law of torts classes, feedback was gathered from students and the instructor of these classes regarding their perceptions of GIGAME, including learning effectiveness and satisfaction. The feedback suggests that GIGAME can serve as a form of game-based constructivist learning as most students indicated that the game helped consolidate their course knowledge while having fun. These qualitative findings are useful for guiding the development of other games that similarly aim to promote socially interactive and constructivist learning environments. This case study recommends the use of GIGAME in classes, although refinements can still be made to its gameplay. Background},

In order to understand the interactions among these correlated aspects and elicit potential threats geared towards a given organization, different security require-ments analysis approaches are proposed in the literature. However, the body of knowledge is yet to unleash its full potential due to the complex nature of security problems, and inadequate ways to improve security awareness of key players in the organization. Objective: Objective(s) of the research study is to improve the security awareness of players utilizing serious games via: (i) Know-how of security concepts and security pro-tection; (ii) guided process of identifying valuable assets and vulnerabilities in a given organizational setting; (iii) guided process of defining successful security attacks to the organization. Method: Important methods used to address the above objectives include: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature to better understand se-curity and game design elements; (ii) designing a serious game using cyber security knowledge and game-based techniques combined with security requirements engineering concepts; (iii) using empirical evaluation (ob-servation and survey) to verify the effectiveness of the proposed game design. Result: The solution proposed is a serious game for security requirements education, which: (i) can be an effective and fun way of learning security related concepts; (ii) mimics a real life problem setting in a presentable and understandable way; (iii) motivates players to learn more about security related concepts in future. Conclusion: From this study, we conclude that the proposed Security Requirement Education Game (SREG) has positive results and is helpful for players of the game to get an understanding of security attacks and vulnerabilities.},

We implemented the proposed system in exercises with nested loops. The evaluation results suggested that students could frequently fulfill learning objectives using the proposed system. However, we also discovered that some students experienced a learning impasse in the classroom. We attempted to address these students with two supporting approaches: bridging the gap between the generalization structures in the program code and their corresponding operations and enabling learners to predict the behavior of the nested loops. In this paper, we extend our previous system with new functions based on our two supporting approaches. Further, we implement the system in another classroom for nested loops. We describe a correlation between the proposed system and an understanding of nested loops using pre-/post-test comparisons.

The findings provide the basis for a broader discussion of the issues relating to the formulation and use of assessment criteria. Assessment entails academics making professional judgements about the standards and quality of students’ work. However, for the educational value of the work entailed in developing assessment criteria to be fully realized, there needs to be a higher level of shared understanding than currently exists (among students, tutors and other stakeholders) of the language in which criteria are couched and the ways in which criteria are applied.},

	abstract = {The twenty years since the first digital video camera was made commercially available has seen significant increases in the use of low-cost, amateur video productions for teaching and learning. In the same period, production and consumption of professionally produced video has also increased, as has the distribution platforms to access it. Furthermore, advances in social media technologies and learning management systems have changed the ways in which video materials can be used in teaching and learning. These developments have, among other things, brought about a complexity in the decision-making behind the production of video materials for higher education teaching and learning. Before we can begin to systematically describe and recommend certain video materials and production approaches for specific learning outcomes, it is useful to consider the existing body of research that describes how video is being used in higher education teaching and learning. This paper uses a landscape literature review of higher education video usage to identify and compare the range of production types and related educational outcomes. The paper concludes by calling for a refreshed research agenda that will assist in identifying the parts of university curricula well suited to being supported by video materials.},

Subjects included 105 students enrolled in a CS1 introductory computer science course at a midwestern university. The study revealed three predictive factors in the following order of importance: comfort level, math, and attribution to luck for success/failure. Comfort level and math background were found to have a positive influence on success, whereas attribution to luck had a negative influence. The study also revealed by considering the different types of previous computer experiences (including formal programming class, self-initiated programming, internet use, game playing, and productivity software use) that both a formal class in programming and game playing were predictive of success. Formal training had a positive influence and games a negative influence on class grade.},

The auditory analysis of the echoes of their ultrasonic sounds requires a detailed comparison of the emission and echoes. Here an auditory model of bat sonar is introduced and evaluated against a set of psychophysical phantom-target, echo-acoustic experiments. The model consists of a relatively detailed simulation of auditory peripheral processing in the bat, Phyllostomus discolor, followed by a functional module consisting of a strobed, normalised, autocorrelation in each frequency channel. The model output is accumulated in a sonar image buffer. The model evaluation is based on the comparison of the image-buffer contents generated in individually simulated psychophysical trials. The model provides reasonably good predictions for both temporal and spectral behavioural sonar processing in terms of sonar delay-, roughness, and phase sensitivity and in terms of sensitivity to the temporal separations in two-front targets and the classification of spectrally divergent phantom targets.},

	abstract = {Vehicular networking has become a significant research area due to its specific features and applications such as standardization, efficient traffic management, road safety and infotainment. Vehicles are expected to carry relatively more communication systems, on board computing facilities, storage and increased sensing power. Hence, several technologies have been deployed to maintain and promote Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Recently, a number of solutions were proposed to address the challenges and issues of vehicular networks. Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is one of the solutions. VCC is a new hybrid technology that has a remarkable impact on traffic management and road safety by instantly using vehicular resources, such as computing, storage and internet for decision making. This paper presents the state-of-the-art survey of vehicular cloud computing. Moreover, we present a taxonomy for vehicular cloud in which special attention has been devoted to the extensive applications, cloud formations, key management, inter cloud communication systems, and broad aspects of privacy and security issues. Through an extensive review of the literature, we design an architecture for VCC, itemize the properties required in vehicular cloud that support this model. We compare this mechanism with normal Cloud Computing (CC) and discuss open research issues and future directions. By reviewing and analyzing literature, we found that VCC is a technologically feasible and economically viable technological shifting paradigm for converging intelligent vehicular networks towards autonomous traffic, vehicle control and perception systems.},

Second, it is well understood that wrapper induction extractors tend to break as the Web changes; heuristic/feature engineering extractors were thought to be immune to a Web site's evolution, but we find that this is not the case: heuristic content extractor performance also tends to degrade over time due to the evolution of Web site forms and practices.

We de- fine local and global features that capture both the local relatedness and global coherence embedded in that text- book. In order to evaluate the proposed features and ex- tracted concept hierarchies, we manually construct concept hierarchies for three well used textbooks by labeling impor- tant concepts for each book chapter. Experiments show that our proposed local and global features achieve better perfor- mance than using only keyphrases to construct the concept hierarchies.

	doi = {10.1007/s11280-009-0059-3},
	abstract = {Templates are pieces of HTML code common to a set of web pages usually adopted by content providers to enhance the uniformity of layout and navigation of theirs Web sites. They are usually generated using authoring/publishing tools or by programs that build HTML pages to publish content from a database. In spite of their usefulness, the content of templates can negatively affect the quality of results produced by systems that automatically process information available in web sites, such as search engines, clustering and automatic categorization programs. Further, the information available in templates is redundant and thus processing and storing such information just once for a set of pages may save computational resources. In this paper, we present and evaluate methods for detecting templates considering a scenario where multiple templates can be found in a collection of Web pages. Most of previous work have studied template detection algorithms in a scenario where the collection has just a single template. The scenario with multiple templates is more realistic and, as it is discussed here, it raises important questions that may require 172 World Wide Web (2009) 12:171–211 extensions and adjustments in previously proposed template detection algorithms. We show how to apply and evaluate two template detection algorithms in this scenario, creating solutions for detecting multiple templates. The methods studied partitions the input collection into clusters that contain common HTML paths and share a high number of HTML nodes and then apply a single-template detection procedure over each cluster. We also propose a new algorithm for single template detection based on a restricted form of bottom-up tree-mapping that requires only small set of pages to correctly identify a template and which has a worst-case linear complexity. Our experimental results over a representative set of Web pages show that our approach is efficient and scalable while obtaining accurate results.},

The central aim of the reported research was to contribute to our understanding of young children's creativity, and describe ways in which peer collaboration can resource, stimulate and enhance classroom-based creative writing activities. The study drew on longitudinal observations of ongoing activities in Year 3 and Year 4 classrooms (children aged 7–9) in England. Selected pairs' collaborative creative writing activities were observed and recorded using video and audio equipment in the literacy classroom and in the ICT suite (13 pairs, about 2–4 occasions each). The research built on the contextualised, qualitative analysis of the social and cognitive processes connected to shared creative text composition. Using an analytic tool developed specifically for creative writing tasks, we linked collaborative and discursive features to cognitive processes associated with writing ('engagement' and 'reflection'). The research has identified discourse patterns and collaborative strategies which facilitate 'sharedness' and thus support joint creative writing activities. The paper discusses two significant aspects of the observed paired creative writing dis-course. It reports the significance of emotions throughout the shared creative writing episodes, including joint reviewing. Also, it shows children's reliance on collaborative floor (Coates, 1996), with discourse building on interruptions and overlaps. We argue that such use of collaborative floor was indicative of joint focus and intense sharing, thus facilitat-ing mutual inspiration in the content generation phases of the children's writing activities. These findings have implications for both educational research and practice, contributing to our understanding of how peer interaction can be used to resource school-based creative activities.},

to evaluate the adequacy of
the unit-test-coverage criterion that
it had employed for years as a guide
for sufficiency of testing. Naturally,
one can think that if increasing
coverage decreases the number
of defects significantly, then coverage
can be considered a criterion
for test sufficiency. To test this hypothesis
in practice, we investigated
the relationship of unit-test-coverage

high coverage did not seem to be any
tangible help in producing defectfree

The most extensively encountered problems were related to testing, task management, effort estimation and tech-nology skills. The developers contributed quite a lot to solving problems with technology skills, but only moderately or less with other topics, whereas the managers contributed quite a lot with most of the top-ics. Contributing to solving problems increased learning moderately for most of the topics. The increases were highest with maintaining motivation and technology skills.

In this paper we propose a minimalistic component model Aranea that is aimed at constructing and integrating server-side web controller frameworks in Java. It allows assembling most of available web programming models out of reusable components and patterns. We also show how to integrate different existing frameworks using Aranea as a common protocol. In its default configuration Aranea supports both developing sophisticated user interfaces using stateful com-ponents and nested processes as well as high-performance stateless components. We propose to use this model as a platform for frame-work development, integration and research. This would allow combining different ideas and avoid reimplementing the same features repeatedly. An open source implementa-tion of Aranea framework together with reusable controls, such as input forms and data lists, and a rendering engine are ready for real-life applications.},

	title = {Automatic {Information} {Extraction} from {Large} {Websites}},

	abstract = {Information extraction from websites is nowadays a relevant problem, usually performed by software modules called wrappers. A key requirement is that the wrapper generation process should be automated to the largest extent, in order to allow for large-scale extraction tasks even in presence of changes in the underlying sites. So far, however, only semi-automatic proposals have appeared in the literature. We present a novel approach to information extraction from websites, which reconciles recent proposals for supervised wrapper induction with the more traditional field of grammar inference. Grammar inference provides a promising theoretical framework for the study of unsupervised—that is, fully automatic—wrapper generation algorithms. However, due to some unrealistic assumptions on the input, these algorithms are not practically applicable to Web information extraction tasks. The main contributions of the article stand in the definition of a class of regular languages, called the prefix mark-up languages, that abstract the structures usually found in HTML pages, and in the definition of a polynomial-time unsupervised learning algorithm for this class. The article shows that, differently from other known classes, prefix mark-up languages and the associated algorithm can be practically used for information extraction purposes. A system based on the techniques described in the article has been implemented in a working prototype. We present some experimental results on known Websites, and discuss opportunities and limitations of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the amount of information accessible on the web is huge. Although web users today expect a more integrated way to access information on the web, it is still rather difficult to "integrate" information from different web sites since most web pages are authored in HTML format, which is actually a presentation-oriented language and is usually considered unstructured. Today, there are many research works aiming at extracting information from web pages. Existing works typically transform the extracting results into structured or semi-structured data formats, thus other applications can further process the results to discover more useful information. Nevertheless, the unstructured nature of HTML makes the transformation process complex and can hardly be widely adopted. In this paper, an annotation-based HTML-to-XML ransformation technology is proposed. The mechanism is developed with both usability and simplicity in mind. With the proposed mechanism, ordinary web site developers simply add annotations to their web pages. Annotated web pages can then be processed by our software libraries and transformed into XML documents, which are machine-understandable. Software agents thus can be developed based on our technology. © 2011 ACM.},

Abstract The present study investigated the impact of class lecture webcasts on student attendance and learning. The research design employed four data collection methods i two class sections -one with webcast access and another without -of the same course taught by the same instructors. Results indicated the following four major findings. (1) Th availability of webcasts negatively impacted student attendance but the availability of other online resources such as PowerPoint slides had a greater negative impact on attendance. (2) Webcast access appeared to nullify the negative effects absenteeism had on student per formance. (3) For most performance measures based on lecture content, more webcast viewing was associated with higher performance. (4) Most students in the webcast sectio reported positive learning experiences and benefits from using webcasts, even though majority also reported using webcasts for missing a class. In summary, these results collectively suggest that webcasts could have positive effects on students' learning experiences and performance, even if class attendance does decline.},

	abstract = {The Entity Linking task consists in automatically identifying and linking the entities mentioned in a text to their URIs in a given Knowledge Base, e.g., Wikipedia. Entity Linking has a large im-pact in several text analysis and information retrieval related tasks. This task is very challenging due to natural language ambiguity. However, not all the entities mentioned in a document have the same relevance and utility in understanding the topics being dis-cussed. Thus, the related problem of identifying the most relevant entities present in a document, also known as Salient Entities, is attracting increasing interest. In this paper we propose SEL, a novel supervised two-step algo-rithm comprehensively addressing both entity linking and saliency detection. The first step is based on a classifier aimed at identi-fying a set of candidate entities that are likely to be mentioned in the document, thus maximizing the precision of the method with-out hindering its recall. The second step is still based on machine learning, and aims at choosing from the previous set the entities that actually occur in the document. Indeed, we tested two dif-ferent versions of the second step, one aimed at solving only the entity linking task, and the other that, besides detecting linked en-tities, also scores them according to their saliency. Experiments conducted on two different datasets show that the proposed algo-rithm outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, and is able to detect salient entities with high accuracy.},

The system dependence graph is an appropriate data structure for slice computation, in that it explicitly represents all dependences that have to be taken into account in slice determination. Construction of the system dependence graph for Web applications is complicated by the presence of dynam-ically generated code. In fact, a Web application builds the HTML code to be transmitted to the browser at run time. Knowledge of such code is essential for slicing. In this paper an algorithm for the static approximation of the dynamically generated HTML code is proposed. The concatenations of constant strings and variables are propagated according to special purpose flow equations, allowing the estimation of the generated code and the refinement of the system dependence graph.},

	abstract = {Peer Assessment (PA) offers a powerful solution that helps teachers in online learning environments to correct essays by distributing the workload among students. Nevertheless, the quality of the results in PA depends on good evaluations of reviewers. Thus, the main drawback for scaling up the use of PA is the presence of inadequate behaviours, such as being too harsh or too soft in the assessment, or even not offering a helpful feedback. This usually occurs due to the lack of motivation and engagement of students in the PA process. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a gamified peer assessment model, where gamification elements are used to engage students in PA activities. Two experiments using the proposed model within an intelligent tutoring system called MeuTutor shows satisfactory outcomes. We verified that the average grade given by students to an essay are equivalent to those given by experts, but the time and costs to complete the assessments were largely reduced. Furthermore, the use of gamification helped to increase the amount of students' access to the system in 64.28\%; increase in 10.53\% the number of essays written and submitted; and improve the quantity and quality of assessments for each essay.},

	abstract = {Web applications often use HTML templates to separate the webpage presentation from its underlying business logic and objects. This is now the de facto standard programming model for Web application development. This paper proposes a novel implementation for existing server-side template engines, FlyingTemplate, for (a) reduced bandwidth consumption in Web application servers, and (b) off-loading HTML generation tasks to Web clients. Instead of producing a fully-generated HTML page, the proposed template engine produces a skeletal script which includes only the dynamic values of the template parameters and the bootstrap code that runs on a Web browser at the client side. It retrieves a client-side template engine and the payload templates separately. With the goals of efficiency, implementation transparency, security, and standards compliance in mind, we developed FlyingTemplate with two design principles: effective browser cache usage, and reasonable compromises which restrict the template usage patterns and relax the security policies slightly but in a controllable way. This approach allows typical template-based Web applications to run effectively with FlyingTemplate. As an experiment, we tested the SPECweb2005 banking application using FlyingTemplate without any other modifications and saw throughput improvements from 1.6x to 2.0x in its best mode. In addition, FlyingTemplate can enforce compliance with a simple security policy, thus addressing the security problems of client-server partitioning in the Web environment.},

	abstract = {XML and XML Schema are used in the geospatial domain for the definition of standards that enhance the interoperability between producers and consumers of spatial data. The size and complexity of these geospatial standards and their associ-ated schemas have been growing with time reaching levels of complexity that make it difficult to build systems based on them in a timely and cost-effective manner. The problem of producing XML processing code based on large schemas has been tradi-tionally solved by using XML data binding generators. Unfortunately, this solution is not always effective when code is generated for resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones. Large and complex schemas often result in the production of code with a large size and a complicated structure that might not fit the device limitations. In this article we present the instance-based XML data binding approach to produce more compact application-specific XML processing code for geospatial applications targeted to mobile devices. The approach tries to reduce the size and complexity of the generated code by using information about how schemas are used by individual appli-cations. Our experimental results suggest a significant simplification of XML Schema 123 356 A.

Despite such opportunity, the poor and disadvantaged are often excluded from access to and participation in this sector. In light of this context, our paper comprises a first step in a project aiming to offer software development classes to disadvantaged youth in Bali, Indonesia. To guide construction of the curriculum, we review publically available online literature around current practice in the provision of non-formal education-based programming classes to the disadvantaged. We wanted to know what might constrain disadvantaged students from participation in this field, what as a consequence might be their response to educational opportunities for this field, and what might be needed to provide 'agentic' learning experiences. We also wanted to evaluate the suitability of Bourdieu's Social Reproduction Theory in terms of reading this literature and providing a broad level framing to guide initial thinking about curriculum construction in response to these questions. This paper presents findings from our review of the online publically available literature and argues the value of Social Reproduction Theory to understanding current practice and guiding preliminary thinking around curriculum construction.},

Of particular interest is the digital document management domain in which their hierarchical structure can be effectively employed in order to organize documents into content-specific categories. Common or standard taxonomies (e.g., the ACM Computing Classification System) contain concepts that are too general for conceptualizing specific knowledge domains. In this paper we introduce a novel automated approach that combines sub-trees from general taxonomies with specialized seed taxonomies by using specific Natural Language Processing techniques. We provide an extensible and generalizable model for combining taxonomies in the practical context of two very large European research projects. Because the manual combination of taxonomies by domain experts is a highly time consuming task, our model measures the semantic relatedness between concept labels in CBOW or skip-gram Word2vec vector spaces. A preliminary quantitative evaluation of the resulting taxonomies is performed after applying a greedy algorithm with incremental thresholds used for matching and combining topic labels.},

Our preliminary experiments evaluate these different slot-based query expansion methods on a collection of news documents, and conclude that: (1) slot-based queries yield better retrieval accuracy compared to keyword-based queries in the complex question problems; and (2) directly applying traditional query expansion on the query terms of each slot does not always work well.},

Within this thesis, I refine my methodology and identify new methods and processes that apply to the context of the creative project example – the fictional world of Chaos Reborn. The most notable of these are 1) making use of invented and real mythology to project depth into the work 2) presenting information to other contributors so they can switch roles as creators and consumers of the franchise content and 3) Identifying the ways in which my creative work interacts with other elements of the transmedia narrative of Chaos Reborn. This thesis also identifies issues around continuance of production for this franchise after an initial raft of publications and suggests a consistent way to approach further development of content. The main creative component of this thesis is a novel set in the world of Chaos Reborn. This is Dreams of Chaos (2016), the first of a planned trilogy entitled The Death of Gods, which tells the story of how the world of Chaos Reborn came about from its alternative history root in Earth’s 14th century. This operates as the background to the game world and anchors the fantasy genre context to a version of our own history. This work is only a part of the writing undertaken to build the world of Chaos Reborn. There is additional material in appendices which contain the other associated writing from this work and from my previous science fiction case study on Elite Dangerous to illustrate the progression and development of my methodology across the genres of science fiction and fantasy},

	abstract = {Digital storytelling was used in a high school classroom in the Midwestern USA as a part of the curriculum for " non-university-bound " rural youth. Though described as " unengaged " , in this paper we illustrate the way this digital storytelling project redefined the teacher-student power relationship, and students responded by producing work that was opinionated, forceful and demonstrated a thorough engagement with academic practices via technologies. Research demonstrates that teacher expectations impact student outcomes, and for marginalised students, it is essential to provide pedagogical opportunities that affirm the student's culture and identity. In this paper, we describe the project and the ways students talked about their education and their future through their digital stories. We use Smyth's (International Journal of Leadership in Education 9(4):285–298, 2006) learner-centred policy constellation to consider the findings, and reframe the way we view these students and their work. By utilising technologies in a meaningful way in the classroom, we anticipate educators can potentially deliver more effective, powerful and engaging pedagogies to all students, including those on nonmainstream educational pathways.},

	abstract = {The popular agile practices of continuous integration and delivery have become an essential part of the software development process in many companies, yet effective methods and tools to support design, description and communication of continuous integration and delivery systems are lacking. Objective: The work reported on in this paper addresses that lack by presenting Cinders — an archi-tecture framework designed specifically to meet the needs of such systems, influenced both by prominent enterprise and software architecture frameworks as well as experiences from continuous integration and delivery modeling in industry. Method: The state of the art for systematic design and description of continuous integration and deliv-ery systems is established through review of literature, whereupon a proposal for an architecture frame-work addressing requirements derived from continuous integration and delivery modeling experiences is proposed. This framework is subsequently evaluated through interviews and workshops with engineers in varying roles in three independent companies. Results: Cinders, an architecture framework designed specifically for the purpose of describing con-tinuous integration and delivery systems is proposed and confirmed to constitute an improvement over previous methods. This work presents software professionals with a demonstrably effective method for describing their continuous integration and delivery systems from multiple points of view and supporting multiple use-cases, including system design, communication and documentation. Conclusion: It is concluded that an architecture framework for the continuous integration and delivery domain has value; at the same time potential for further improvement is identified, particularly in the area of tool support for data collection as well as for manual modeling.},

Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating a program that meets a given specification. Both program verification and program synthesis can be viewed as search problems, for proofs and programs, respectively. For these search problems, we present approaches based on user-provided insights in the form of templates. Templates are hints about the syntactic forms of the invariants and pro-grams, and help guide the search for solutions. We show how to reduce the template-based search problem to satisfiability solving, which permits the use of off-the-shelf solvers to effi-ciently explore the search space. Template-based approaches have allowed us to verify and synthesize programs outside the abilities of previous verifiers and synthesizers. Our approach can verify and synthesize difficult algorithmic textbook pro-grams (e.g., sorting and dynamic programming-based algo-rithms) and difficult arithmetic programs.},

	title = {{F4F}: {Taint} {Analysis} of {Framework}-based {Web} {Applications}},
	abstract = {This paper presents F4F (Framework For Frameworks), a system for effective taint analysis of framework-based web applications. Most modern web applications utilize one or more web frameworks, which provide useful abstractions for common functionality. Due to extensive use of reflec-tive language constructs in framework implementations, ex-isting static taint analyses are often ineffective when applied to framework-based applications. While previous work has included ad hoc support for certain framework constructs, adding support for a large number of frameworks in this manner does not scale from an engineering standpoint. F4F employs an initial analysis pass in which both appli-cation code and configuration files are processed to generate a specification of framework-related behaviors. A taint anal-ysis engine can leverage these specifications to perform a much deeper, more precise analysis of framework-based ap-plications. Our specification language has only a small num-ber of simple but powerful constructs, easing analysis engine integration. With this architecture, new frameworks can be handled with no changes to the core analysis engine, yield-ing significant engineering benefits. We implemented specification generators for several web frameworks and added F4F support to a state-of-the-art taint-analysis engine. In an experimental evaluation, the taint analysis enhanced with F4F discovered 525 new issues across nine benchmarks, a harmonic mean of 2.10X more issues per benchmark. Furthermore, manual inspection of a subset of the new issues showed that many were exploitable or reflected bad security practice.},

Therefore, technical content is typically created following a strategy where modular units of text have references to each other. One of the main challenges faced by technical authors is to avoid duplicat-ing existing content, as this adds unnecessary effort, gener-ates undesirable inconsistencies, and dramatically increases maintenance and translation costs. However, there are few computational tools available to support this activity. This paper investigates the use of different similarity methods for the task of identification of reuse opportunities in techni-cal writing. We evaluated our results using existing ground truth as well as feedback from technical authors. Finally, we also propose a tool that combines text similarity algorithms with interactive visualizations to aid authors in understand-ing differences in a collection of topics and identifying reuse opportunities.},

Rather than requiring that programs be verified in separate a posteriori analysis, Verily supports construction via a series of Recipes, which are properties of an application that are enforced at compile time. In addition to introducing the Verily framework, we also present two Recipes: the Core Recipe, an application architecture for web applications designed to replace traditional server-side Model View Controller, and the Global Mutable State Recipe, which enables developers to use sessions within their applications without resorting to the use of unrestricted global mutable state.

In current approaches, customers usually specify the options and get the price or simple pictures of the object. In this paper we present a framework in which customer options and size parameters are gathered using the Internet. It is used to automatically generate a 3-dimensional computer-aided design model of the product, estimate the price of the product, and generate assembly sequence information. The framework for mass customization of products necessitates information management among different segments of the company and the customer.

Although hand crafting an extraction program for a specific template is time-consuming but straightforward, it is desirable to automatically generate template extraction programs from examples of lists and tables in html documents. Supervised approaches have been shown to achieve high accuracy, but they require manual labelling of training examples, which is also time consuming. Fully unsupervised approaches, which extract rows and columns by detecting regularities in the data, cannot provide sufficient accuracy for practical domains. We describe a novel technique, Post-supervised Learning, which exploits unsupervised learning to avoid the need for training examples, while minimally involving the user to achieve high accuracy. We have developed unsupervised algorithms to extract the number of rows and adopted a dynamic programming algorithm for extracting columns.

	abstract = {Physics, biology, and medicine have well-refined public explanations of their research processes. Even in simplified form, these provide guidance about what counts as "good research" both inside and outside the field. Soft-ware engineering has not yet explicitly identified and explained either our re-search processes or the ways we recognize excellent work. Science and engineering research fields can be characterized in terms of the kinds of questions they find worth investigating, the research methods they adopt, and the criteria by which they evaluate their results. I will present such a characterization for software engineering, showing the diversity of research strategies and the way they shift as ideas mature. Understanding these strategies should help software engineers design research plans and report the results clearly; it should also help explain the character of software engineering re-search to computer science at large and to other scientists.},

	title = {Automated test of evolving software},
	isbn = {0-321-21026-3},
	abstract = {Computers and the software they run are pervasive, yet released software is often unreliable, which has many consequences. Loss of time and earnings can be caused by application software (such as word processors) behaving incorrectly or crashing. Serious disruption can occur as in the l4th August 2003 blackouts in North East USA and Canadal, or serious injury or death can be caused as in the Therac-25 overdose incidents. One way to improve the quality of software is to test it thoroughly. However, software testing is time consuming, the resources, capabilities and skills needed to carry it out are often not available and the time required is often curtailed because of pressures to meet delivery deadlines3. Automation should allow more thorough testing in the time available and improve the quality of delivered software, but there are some problems with automation that this research addresses. Firstly, it is difficult to determine ifthe system under test (SUT) has passed or failed a test. This is known as the oracle problem4 and is often ignored in software testing research. Secondly, many software development organisations use an iterative and incremental process, known as evolutionary development, to write software. Following release, software continues evolving as customers demand new features and improvements to existing ones5. This evolution means that automated test suites must be maintained throughout the life ofthe software. A contribution of this research is a methodology that addresses automatic generation of the test cases, execution of the test cases and evaluation of the outcomes from running each test. "Predecessor" software is used to solve the oracle problem. This is software that already exists, such as a previous version of evolving software, or software from a different vendor that solves the same, or similar, problems. However, the resulting oracle is assumed not be perfect, so rules are defined in an interface, which are used by the evaluator in the test evaluation stage to handle the expected differences. The interface also specifies functional inputs and outputs to the SUT. An algorithm has been developed that creates a Markov Chain Transition Matrix (MCTM) model of the SUT from the interface. Tests are then generated automatically by making a random walk of the MCTM. This means that instead of maintaining a large suite of tests, or a large model of the SUT, only the interface needs to be maintained.},

They track who made edits and when, and provide tools for comparing changes made and for resolving conflicts when the same file is edited by two people. Attaching metadata to files which stays with the data and tracking changes can be difficult if the file format does not support it. In this paper we present a new and innovative architecture for recording key-value metadata for objects in a revision control system, specifically Git. The utility and maturity of version control system tools make them a good candidate for a metadata store. We take advantage of Git's data store to permit the values to be blobs, opening up other possibilities such as defining thumbnails for files and folders. Propagation rules are presented, detailing when metadata follows a file after modifications to the repository. A prototype version of a tool is presented and the usefulness of the architecture is demonstrated with a number of examples. Adapting the approach to other systems such as Mercurial and Subversion is also discussed.},

These transformations have been defined by means of graph grammars and template engines extended with traceability capabilities. Our framework also allows the models to be reused for different applications since a catalogue of requirements is provided. This framework enables the development of home automation applications with techniques for improving the quality of both the process and the models obtained. In order to evaluate the benefits of the approach, we conducted a survey among developers that used the framework. The analysis of the outcome of this survey shows which conditions should be fulfilled in order to increase reusability.},

	abstract = {Ontology Learning is defined as the set of methods used for building from scratch, enriching or adapting an existing ontology in a semi-automatic fashion using hetero- geneous information sources. This data-driven procedure uses text, electronic dic- tionaries, linguistic ontologies and structured and semi-structured information to acquire knowledge. Recently, with the enormous growth of the Information Society, the Web has be- come a valuable source of information for almost every possible domain of knowl- edge. This has motivated researchers to start considering the Web as a valid reposi- tory for Information Retrieval and Knowledge Acquisition. However, the Web suffers from problems that are not typically observed in classical information repositories: human oriented presentation, noise, untrusted sources, high dynamicity and over- whelming size. Even though, it also presents characteristics that can be interesting for knowledge acquisition: due to its huge size and heterogeneity it has been assumed that the Web approximates the real distribution of the information in humankind. The present work introduces a novel approach for ontology learning, introducing new methods for knowledge acquisition from the Web. The adaptation of several well known learning techniques to the web corpus and the exploitation of particular char- acteristics of the Web environment composing an automatic, unsupervised and do- main independent approach distinguishes the present proposal from previous works. With respect to the ontology building process, the following methods have been developed: i) extraction and selection of domain related terms, organising them in a taxonomical way; ii) discovery and label of non-taxonomical relationships between concepts; iii) additional methods for improving the final structure, including the de- tection of named entities, class features, multiple inheritance and also a certain degree of semantic disambiguation. The full learning methodology has been implemented in a distributed agent-based fashion, providing a scalable solution. It has been evaluated for several well distinguished domains of knowledge, obtaining good quality results. Finally, several direct applications have been developed, including automatic struc- turing of digital libraries and web resources, and ontology-based Web Information Retrieval. vii},

Most research on defense techniques has focused on securing existing legacy applica-tions written in general-purpose languages, such as Java and PHP. However, recent and emerging applications have widely adopted web templating frameworks that have received little attention in research. Web templating frameworks of-fer an ideal opportunity to ensure safety against scripting attacks by secure construction, but most of today's frame-works fall short of achieving this goal. We propose a novel and principled type-qualifier based mech-anism that can be bolted onto existing web templating frame-works. Our solution permits rich expressiveness in the tem-plating language while achieving backwards compatibility, per-formance and formal security through a context-sensitive auto-sanitization (CSAS) engine. To demonstrate its practicality, we implement our mechanism in Google Closure Templates, a commercially used open-source templating framework that is used in GMail, Google Docs and other applications. Our approach is fast, precise and retrofits to existing commer-cially deployed template code without requiring any changes or annotations.},

The technique is a Day-in-the-life scenario, which extends on the work of personas and scenarios. The scenario has two forms: a narrative, and a diagram. Our narrative captures typical daily events in the life of the operator and conveys the gist of their day in terms of attentional focus and tensions between and within their activities. The Day-in-the-life diagram uses the UML sequence diagram notation to depict the narrative visually, bringing important details of the day to the fore.

	abstract = {Today, the Web is the largest source of infor-mation worldwide. There is currently a strong trend for decision-making applications such as Data Warehousing (DW) and Business Intelligence (BI) to move onto the Web, especially in the cloud. Integrating data into DW/BI appli-cations is a critical and time-consuming task. To make better decisions in DW/BI applications, next generation data integration poses new requirements to data integration sys-tems, over those posed by traditional data integration. In this paper, we propose a generic, metadata-based, service-oriented, and event-driven approach for integrating Web data timely and autonomously. Beside handling data het-erogeneity, distribution and interoperability, our approach satisfies near real-time requirements and realize active data integration. For this sake, we design and develop a frame-work that utilizes Web standards (e.g., XML and Web services) for tackling data heterogeneity, distribution and interoperability issues. Moreover, our framework utilizes Active XML (AXML) to warehouse passive data as well as services to integrate active and dynamic data on-the-fly. AXML embedded services and changes detection services ensure near real-time data integration. Furthermore, the idea of integrating Web data actively and autonomously revolves around mining events logged by the data integration envi- ronment. Therefore, we propose an incremental XML-based algorithm for mining association rules from logged events. Then, we define active rules dynamically upon mined data to automate and reactivate integration tasks. Finally, as a proof of concept, we implement a framework prototype as a Web application using open-source tools.},

Adv Physiol Educ 39: 218–222, 2015; doi:10.1152/advan.00004.2015.—In 2010, second-year physiology (n ? 165) had a traditional single 3-h end-of-semester exam. To provide diagnostic feedback earlier, for students enrolled in 2011 (n? 128), we incorporated an in-class exam at 3 wk in addition to the final exam. Based on initial analysis and positive student comments, for the 2012 cohort (n ? 148), we expanded this to incorporate four 1-h in-class exams every 3 wk plus a short final integrative exam. Average scores from exams and questionnaires (student evaluations of learning and teaching, 10 questions) were compared among 2010, 2011, and 2012 cohorts. We also compared scores in the practical component of the course, which had a constant format for all cohorts. Data are given as means?SD; statistical analyses were done with unpaired two-way Students t-tests. From 2010 to 2012, there was a significant improve- ment in total exam scores (59.7 ? 15.8 vs. 68.6 ? 14.2, P ? 0.001) but no significant change in total practical scores (72.3 ? 9.0 vs. 74.4 ? 10.2, P ? 0.05), indicating that the rise in exam score was not due to higher academic abilities of the 2012 cohort. Overall mean student evaluation of learning and teaching responses (4.9 ? 0.4 vs. 5.3 ? 0.3, P ? 0.015) and overall percent broad agreement (66.0 ? 8.0 vs. 79.2 ? 7.5, P ? 0.003) indicated a significant improvement in student satisfaction. In conclusion, both learning outcome and per- ceived course quality were enhanced by the increased frequency of examinations, possibly by promoting consistent student study habits.},

	abstract = {Student retention remains an ongoing concern for higher education institutions worldwide. In the present study, we examine the predictive utility of identity styles, professional identity and academic commitment to academic achievement. We asked 120 second-year students in the profession of engineering in an augmented degree programme to complete the Identity Styles Inventory, the Engineering Identity Factors Inventory and the Academic Commitment Scale. We found that a normative identity style predicted professional engineering identity and meaningfulness, which predicted the participants' investments in their studies. Additionally, a diffuse-avoidant identity style negatively predicted professional identity, meaningfulness and satisfaction, which provides empirical evidence of the contribution of identity to academic commitment. None of the variables we studied predicted academic achievement. Our findings are relevant, given current debates on access, equity and decolonisation in higher education, because it suggests that students' sense of identity largely influences whether they feel a sense of belonging at university. Although identity styles and meaningfulness are not significant direct predictors of academic achievement, they probably do have an indirect effect on academic achievement through their direct influence on investment.},

The company manages a portfolio of more than 290 journals and over 2,350 books and book series volumes, as well as providing an extensive range of online products and additional customer resources and services. Abstract Purpose – The aim of this research is the conversion of the bibliographic records between the following different formats for bibliographic material processing – the YUMARC (which is a variant of the UNIMARC format in which the Serbian BISIS system operates), UNIMARC and MARC 21 format. Design/methodology/approach – The CASE tools that support the information system developing methodology based on the XML technologies are used. Findings – The result is the specification and implementation of information requirements for the conversion of the bibliographic records created in the BISIS system into the UNIMARC or MARC 21 format. Research limitations/implications – The specification of the rules for bibliographic record conversion is not formalized, so the implementation of these rules cannot be done automatically. If the rules could be formalized, then a generator of the programming code could be developed for the implementation of the rules for the bibliographic record conversion. Practical implications – The research result is applied for the conversion of the YUMARC bibliographic records in the Library of the Department for Mathematics and Informatics of Novi Sad University. The conversion of the records is made at first into the UNIMARC format and subsequently from the UNIMARC format into the records of the MARC 21 format. The task of conversion of the bibliographic records formed in the BISIS software system in the UNIMARC or the MARC 21 format is solved in that way. Originality/value – The originality of the work is contained in the application of the XML technologies for the conversion of the bibliographic records between the different bibliographic formats (YUMARC, UNIMARC and MARC 21). For each of the formats an XML schema is formed and record conversion between the different formats is done by the XSLT transformations.},

	doi = {10.1145/2034691.2034733},
	abstract = {A simple and intuitive way to organize a huge document collection is by a topic hierarchy. Generally two steps are carried out to build a topic hierarchy automatically: 1) hierarchical document clustering and 2) cluster labeling. For both steps, a good textual document representation is essential. The bag-of-words is the common way to represent text collections. In this representation, each document is represented by a vector where each word in the document collection represents a dimension (feature). This approach has well known problems as the high dimensionality and sparsity of data. Besides, most of the concepts are composed by more than one word, as "document engineering" or "text mining". In this paper an approach called bag-of-related-words is proposed to generate features compounded by a set of related words with a dimensionality smaller than the bag-of-words. The features are extracted from each textual document of a collection using association rules. Different ways to map the document into transactions in order to allow the extraction of association rules and interest measures to prune the number of features are analyzed. To evaluate how much the proposed approach can aid the topic hierarchy building, we carried out an objective evaluation for the clustering structure, and a subjective evaluation for topic hierarchies. All the results were compared with the bag-of-words. The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed representation is better than the bag-of-words for the topic hierarchy building. © 2011 ACM.},

This article draws on data from a recent qualitative study into supervision in doctoral studies in social science disciplines in Australia. The data-set for this article comes from 10 close-to-completion doctoral students. This article argues that it is the mid-career candidates (35–44 years of age) who are least well-served by the focus on work-readiness skills and this discourse serves to reinforce a deficit model where prior knowledge and experience are undervalued. This impacts negatively on the self-efficacy of this cohort by undermining established professional identities and consequently diminishing agency.},

The role of these sensors is to monitor human beings, the environment or instrumentation and provide continuous streams of information regarding their status or well being. In the case study presented in this work, the network is provided by football teams with sensors generating continuous heart rate values during a number of different sporting activities. In wireless networks such as these, the requirement is for methods of data management and transforma-tion in order to present data in a format suited to high level queries. In effect, what is required is a traditional database-style query interface where domain experts can continue to probe for the answers required in more specialised environments. The challenge arises from the gap that emerges between the low level sensor output and the high level user requirements of the domain experts. This paper describes a process to close this gap by automatically harvesting the raw sensor data and providing semantic enrichment through the addition of context data.},

	doi = {10.1145/2661136.2661140},
	abstract = {The development of robust and efficient interactive web applications is challenging, because developers have to deal with multiple programming languages, asynchronous events, propagating data and events between clients and servers, data consistency and much more. Several approaches for (partly) addressing these challenges have been proposed. Two relevant ones are (1) multi-tier languages and (2) func-tional reactive programming (FRP). Multi-tier programming languages support the development of client and server in a single language, and hide much of the complexity related to distribution. FRP offers the right abstractions to make event-driven programming convenient, safe and compos-able. However, existing web frameworks and programming languages exploit the benefits of both approaches separately, for example by restricting the use of FRP to the client side. We propose multi-tier FRP for the Web, a novel approach to writing web applications that deeply integrates FRP and multi-tier languages, and where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In multi-tier FRP, the developer programs server and client together as an FRP application composed of behaviors (signals) and events. He/she chooses explicitly where the boundary between server and client is crossed. To make our approach more concrete and provide evidence of its potential, this paper presents a concrete design and im-plementation of a multi-tier FRP API for the web in the programming language Scala, using an embedded JavaScript DSL that makes Scala usable as a multi-tier language. This allows us to present initial evidence of the benefits of the multi-tier FRP approach on example applications, and to ex-periment with possible answers to the remaining questions. Concretely, we show possible solutions for problems like exposing client identity on the server and efficiently pre-loading clients with the latest application state. Our results show that multi-tier FRP is a promising, declarative, yet practical way of writing web applications.},

In this study, we gather a very large data set from GitHub (728 projects, 63 million SLOC, 29,000 authors, 1.5 million commits, in 17 languages) in an attempt to shed some empirical light on this question. This reasonably large sample size allows us to use a mixed-methods approach, combining multiple regression modeling with visualization and text analytics, to study the effect of language features such as static versus dynamic typing and allowing versus disallowing type confusion on software quality. By triangulat-ing findings from different methods, and controlling for con-founding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language design does have a signifi-cant, but modest effect on software quality. Most notably, it does appear that disallowing type confusion is modestly better than allowing it, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that functional languages are somewhat bet-ter than procedural languages. It is worth noting that these modest effects arising from language design are overwhelm-ingly dominated by the process factors such as project size, team size, and commit size. However, we caution the reader that even these modest effects might quite possibly be due to other, intangible process factors, for example, the prefer-ence of certain personality types for functional, static lan-guages that disallow type confusion.},

Software component reuse can make an important contribution to significant gains in productivity. However, to achieve its full potential, objective and automatable reuse guidelines are needed to support the designers of reusable components. We know clearly the difficulties that are faced when trying to reuse a component that is not designed for reuse. Therefore, the emphasis of the research described here is on design for reuse rather than design with reuse. Design for reuse is a process of creating potentially reusable components. To create such reusable components we need to define the characteristics, for which a set of practical and objective reuse guidelines has been formulated (a practical step that has been taken in this project on reuse guidelines). An approach has been taken to support the process of design for reuse, based on language-oriented reusability (automating a language support for reuse) and domain-oriented reusability for which a domain analysis technique is used (automating a domain support for reuse). Domain modelling is done using generic component templates. The language chosen is Ada, and the application domain chosen is components of abstract data structures for which a classification scheme is proposed.

The fu{\textasciitilde}1 article runs to 24 Resonance pages and I had the difficult task of editing it to a size we can accommodate. I have picked out three parts of his article, one on his idea of a miniature recording camera, the other on speech to text system and the third on 'Memex' a machine he hypothesized to systematically navigate a collection of knowledge. Memex is the first idea which germinated hypertext and later the world wide web. I would, however, urge those who are interested to read the entire article which is available in the following web address http://www.theatlantic.com/ unbound/flashbksl computer Ibushf. htm.},

	abstract = {Server page technique is commonly used for implementing web application user interfaces. Server pages can represent many similar web pages in a generic form. Yet our previous study revealed high rates of repetitions in web applications, particularly in the user interfaces. Code duplication, commonly known as 'cloning', signals untapped opportunities to achieve simpler, smaller, more generic, and more maintainable web applications. Using PHP Server page technique, we conducted a case study to explore how far Server page technique can be pushed to achieve clone-free web applications. Our study suggests that clone unification using Server pages affects system qualities (e.g., runtime performance) to an extent that may not be acceptable in many project situations. Our paper discusses the trade-offs we observed when applying Server pages to unify clones in web applications. We expect our findings to help in developing and validating complementary techniques that can unify clones without incurring such trade-offs.},

These developments influence the structure and behavior of the business processes that represent the work and of the Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) that support them. Consequently, the architecture of BPMS has changed a lot over the past two decades. However, there is no systematic overview of the research done in this area since the Workflow reference model first set the standard for BPMS architecture in 1995. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of BPMS architectures, by analyzing 41 primary studies taken from a gross collection of 608 research papers. The BPMS architectures that served as primary studies were compared with respect to the reference architecture that they are based on, the level of elaboration at which they are described, the architectural styles that they use, the means with which they are evaluated, and the functionality that they support. The resulting comparison provides an overview of and insights into the current body of knowledge on BPMS architectures.},

In this work, we aim at extracting the main features on enhanced children's eBooks and propose a model, named Fábulas—the Portuguese word for fables—that allows authors to create interactive multimedia chil-dren's eBooks declaratively. The model was conceived by taking, as a starting point, a systematic analysis of the common concepts, with the focus on identifying and categorizing recurring characteristics and pointing out functional and non-functional requirements that establish a strong orientation towards the set of desirable abstrac-tions of an underlying model. Moreover, the paper presents a case study for the implementation of Fábulas on the Web, and discusses the authoring of a complete interactive story over it.},

These components are instantiated un-der the control of a specification structure (JSON objects, Javascript Standard Object Notation) from which the DSL and the corresponding compiler can be generated.

In such scenarios, XML is often constrained by an XML Schema grammar, which can be used during parsing to improve performance. Although traditional grammar-based parser generation techniques could be applied to the XML Schema grammar, the expressiveness of XML Schema does not lend itself well to the generic intermediate representations associated with these approaches. In this paper we present a method for generating efficient parsers by using the schema component model itself as the representation of the grammar. We show that the model supports the full expressive power of the XML Schema, and we present results demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing parsers.},

	abstract = {Context: Gamification seeks for improvement of the user's engagement, motivation, and performance when carrying out a certain task, by means of incorporating game mechanics and elements, thus making that task more attractive. Much research work has studied the application of gamification in software engineering for increasing the engagement and results of developers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic mapping of the field of gamification in software engineering in an attempt to characterize the state of the art of this field identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping with a view to finding the primary studies in the existing literature, which were later classified and analyzed according to four criteria: the software process area addressed, the gamification elements used, the type of research method followed, and the type of forum in which they were published. A subjective evaluation of the studies was also carried out to evaluate them in terms of methodology, empirical evidence, integration with the organization, and replicability. Results: As a result of the systematic mapping we found 29 primary studies, published between January 2011 and June 2014. Most of them focus on software development, and to a lesser extent, requirements, project management, and other support areas. In the main, they consider very simple gamification mechanics such as points and badges, and few provide empirical evidence of the impact of gamification. Conclusions: Existing research in the field is quite preliminary, and more research effort analyzing the impact of gamification in SE would be needed. Future research work should look at other game mechanics in addition to the basic ones and should tackle software process areas that have not been fully studied, such as requirements, project management, maintenance, or testing. Most studies share a lack of methodological support that would make their proposals replicable in other settings. The integration of gamification with an organization's existing tools is also an important challenge that needs to be taken up in this field.},

	volume = {12},
	doi = {10.1186/s41039-017-0046-8},
	abstract = {Learning from interactive learning environments enriched with multiple external representations (MERs) is often beneficial. The learning benefits of MERs highly rely on the development of Representational Competence. Representational Competence refers to an ability to translate and see relations between MERs. The relevant research findings have consistently reported learners' difficulty in relating and translating in MERs due to insufficient development of Representational Competence. Although dynamic linking is one of the strategies recommended to address this issue, it offers mixed results. This paper reports design of a new interaction feature that overcomes some of the limitations of traditional dynamically linked representations. We designed an additional interaction in dynamically linked MERs to support learners' cognitive demands; we refer to this as Reciprocative Dynamic Linking. The goal of this additional affordance was to strengthen learners' cross-representation cognitive linkage by promoting Representational Competence. The paper reports the study conducted to investigate effects of Reciprocative Dynamic Linking on students' Representational Competence. The said study was conducted in a course on Signals and Systems from Electrical Engineering program (N = 24). The subjects were assigned to two conditions: a Simulation and a Simulation with Reciprocative Dynamic Linking. The representation competence was assessed with an instrument for measuring Representational Competence within Signals and Systems domain. The effect of Reciprocative Dynamic Linking on learners' cognitive load was also investigated. The results confirmed that Reciprocative Dynamic Linking could lead to improvement in Representational Competence and thus, higher learning for " Apply and Analyze Procedural knowledge " categories of tasks. Reciprocative Dynamic Linking also promoted germane cognitive load of learners, as it could offer the required cognitive support to improve learners' Representational Competence. The findings from semi-structured interviews and screen capture analysis corroborated the results. This paper provides details of how to design Reciprocative Dynamic Linking in interactive learning environments and its effect on learners' Representational Competence. Apart from establishing learning effectiveness of Reciprocative Dynamic Linking, the study further contributes by confirming the role of cognitive processing of learners while learning from interactive learning environments. The findings from the study suggest designing strategies not for just (Continued on next page)},

	abstract = {Many people are first exposed to code through web development, yet little is known about the barriers beginners face in these formative experiences. In this article, we describe a study of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory web development course taken by both computing majors and general education students. Using data collected during the initial weeks of the course, we investigate the nature of the syntax errors they make when learning HTML and CSS, and how they resolve them. This is accomplished through the deployment of openHTML, a lightweight web-based code editor that logs user activity. Our analysis reveals that nearly all students made syntax errors that remained unresolved in their assessments, and that these errors continued weeks into the course. Approximately 20\% of these errors related to the relatively complex system of rules that dictates when it is valid for HTML elements to be nested in one another. On the other hand, 35\% of errors related to the relatively simple tag syntax determining how HTML elements are nested. We also find that validation played a key role in resolving errors: While the majority of unresolved errors were present in untested code, nearly all of the errors that were detected through validation were eventually corrected. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications for computing education.},

This vision is even more critical today in our open interconnected world of Clouds and Devices. The last 20 years represents a real-life worldwide experiment in this area that fueled a massive set of market applications. In this talk, we review the history and trends of a lot of what is enabling today's core interchanges on the internet: from initial research adding document user interfaces to data, to the specification of structured documents, to the generalization of document markup techniques to the wide acceptance of document databases. We will also review our share of historical acronyms such as 'Star', 'Grif', 'OpenDoc', 'WorldWideWeb/Nexus', 'Amaya', 'InfoPath' 'HTML', 'SGML', 'XML', 'JSON', 'YAML', 'Markdown', 'Schema', 'Semantics','MongoDB', 'Hadoop', 'DocumentDB' and many others. We will then turn, cautiously and humbly, to the future and try to guess: what would the world need? And what do we need to think about to make it happen? We truly believe in the potential of the open Internet. We see pieces of information (that we once called "Diamonds of the Internet"), being created, shared, re-shaped, re-routed, modified by users or tiny small devices, understood through big data and machine learning, and processed by cloud services. We see the potential of fundamentally designing open platforms connected worldwide. By bridging technologies, we create higher level abstractions and thus more complex organisms (software) that can help everyone. But at the core remains the need for semi-structured open information fundamentally unifying documents and data.},

	abstract = {As it provides a firm foundation for advancing knowledge, a solid literature review is a critical feature of any academic investigation. Yet, there are several challenges in performing literature reviews including: i) lack of access to the literature because of costs, ii) fracturing of the literature into many sources, lack of access and comprehensive coverage in many databases and search engines, and iii) the use of proprietary software lock-in strategies for bibliographic software, which can make porting literature reviews between organizations cumbersome and costly. These challenges often result in poor quality literature reviews completed by a single researcher unfamiliar with the approaches to the same research in other sub-fields and static reviews that are often lost to the scientific community. In this paper, an open source approach will be expanded to the application of improving the quality of literature reviews by providing best practices. Although there are many types and goals of literature reviews, it is found that all of them can be improved using a tool chain of free and open source software (FOSS) and methods. Specifically, this paper will provide a clear framework for i) comprehensive searching and obtaining access to the literature, ii) the use of FOSS for all steps including browsing, bibliographic software, and writing and iii) documenting a literature review to encourage collaboration of a dynamic document that lives into the future. This approach solves the current challenges of literature reviews and provides benefits of lower labor and economic costs, improved researcher control, and increased potential for collaboration. Finally, the challenges of using this approach and methods to overcome them are reviewed and future work is described.},

This paper proposes an experimental approach for assessing the performance of web service frameworks under the presence of security attacks. The approach is based on a client that exchanges non-malicious messages with an infrastructure that includes the framework being assessed and several web service applications. Attacks are performed by a malicious client application and performance measures are collected during the process (from the point-of-view of legitimate users). Five web service frameworks have been assessed and results show that improvements are urgently needed, as several cases of performance degradation were observed.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Web services frequently provide business–critical functionality over the Internet, being widely exposed and thus representing an attractive target for security attacks. In particular, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks may inflict severe damage to web service providers, including financial and reputation losses. This way, it is vital that the software supporting services deployment (i.e., the web service framework) is able to provide a secure environment, so that the services can be delivered even when facing attacks. In this paper, we present an experimental approach that allows understanding how well a given web service framework is prepared to handle DoS attacks. The approach is based on a set of phases that include the execution of a large number of well-known DoS attacks against a target framework and the classification of the observed behavior. Results show that four out of the six frameworks tested are vulnerable to at least one type of DoS attack, and indicate that even very popular platforms require urgent security improvements.},

This quasi-experimental study was designed to compare the effectiveness of PowerPoint presentations (PPP) and conventional lecture/discussion sessions on the pedagogical content knowledge of the student-teachers of English. PPP were used in the experimental group and conventional lecture/discussion sessions were employed in the control group (CG). The findings revealed that the treatment process was effective on both groups, but the CG achieved better in the post-test. Following the treatment process, the efficiency of the applications was also tested by means of a questionnaire. The CG reflected more positive attitudes towards the conventional lecture/discussion in terms of the quality of instructional strategies, academic language use, professional development, professional perception and problem-solving.},

	abstract = {Web software applications have become complex, sophisticated programs that are based on novel computing technologies. Their most essential characteristic is that they represent a different kind of software deployment—most of the software is never delivered to customers’ computers, but remains on servers, allowing customers to run the software across the web. Although powerful, this deployment model brings new challenges to developers and testers. Checking static HTML links is no longer sufficient; web applications must be evaluated as complex software products. This paper focuses on three aspects of web applications that are unique to this type of deployment: (1) an extremely loose form of coupling that features distributed integration, (2) the ability that users have to directly change the potential flow of execution, and (3) the dynamic creation of HTML forms. Taken together, these aspects allow the potential control flow to vary with each execution, thus the possible control flows cannot be determined statically, prohibiting several standard analysis techniques that are fundamental to many software engineering activities. This paper presents a new way to model web applications, based on software couplings that are new to web applications, dynamic flow of control, distributed integration, and partial dynamic web application development. This model is based on the notion of atomic sections, which allow analysis tools to build the analog of a control flow graph for web applications. The atomic section model has numerous applications in web applications; this paper applies the model to the problem of testing web applications.},

	abstract = {—Higher demands for more reliable and maintain-able JavaScript-based web applications have led to the recent development of MVC (Model-View-Controller) frameworks. One of the main advantages of using these frameworks is that they abstract out DOM API method calls, which are one of the leading causes of web application faults, due to their often complicated interaction patterns. However, MVC frameworks are susceptible to inconsistencies between the identifiers and types of variables and functions used throughout the application. In response to this problem, we introduce a formal consistency model for web applications made using MVC frameworks. We propose an approach – called AUREBESH – that automatically detects inconsistencies in such applications. We evaluate AUREBESH by conducting a fault injection experiment and by running it on real applications. Our results show that AUREBESH is accurate, with an overall recall of 96.1\% and a precision of 100\%. It is also useful in detecting bugs, allowing us to find 15 real-world bugs in applications built on AngularJS, a popular MVC framework.},

To do so we combine Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing algorithms to extract and manipulate relevant text concepts from document images. Such textual information is then visually embedded within each document image to improve the classification results of a Convolutional Neural Network. Our experiments prove that the overall document classification accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network trained using these text-augmented document images is considerably higher than the one achieved by a similar model trained solely on classic document images, especially when different classes of documents share similar visual characteristics.},

	title = {A {Rust}-based {Runtime} for the {Internet} of {Things}},
	abstract = {As the number of connected devices increases, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), reliability and security become more important. C and C++ are common programming languages for IoT devices, mostly due to their fine-grained memory management and low runtime overhead. As these languages are not memory-safe and memory management has proven to be difficult to handle correctly, problems such as buffer overflows and dangling pointers are likely to increase as the IoT devices become more prevalent. These problems can result in reliability and security issues. In contrast to C and C++, Rust is a memory-safe systems programming language that, just like C and C++, provides low runtime overhead and fine-grained memory management. Potentially, Rust can reduce the number of unreliable and insecure connected devices as a result of memory safety. Tock is an embedded operating system implemented in Rust, and thus it is inherently safe when it comes to memory management. In this thesis, we investigate if Rust is suitable to develop device drivers. We implement four different device drivers covering a range of functions and evaluate the energy consumption as well as the execution time of our drivers compared to other current state-of-the-art embedded operating systems. These device drivers enhance the usability of Tock for connected devices. With the device drivers, we show that Tock introduces an overhead in terms of execution speed but has a similar energy consumption in comparison to the current state-of-the-art embedded operating systems. Despite the increased runtime overhead, we argue that the benefits of Tock and Rust, i.e., increased reliability and security along with similar power consumption exceeds the negative aspect. Finally, we conclude that Rust and Tock are appropriate for developing device drivers for IoT devices.},

However, the approaches using n-gram face challenges in capturing the patterns at higher levels of abstraction due to the mismatch between the sequence nature in n-grams and the structure nature of syntax and semantics in source code. This paper presents GraLan, a graph-based statistical language model and its application in code sugges-tion. GraLan can learn from a source code corpus and compute the appearance probabilities of any graphs given the observed (sub)graphs. We use GraLan to develop an API suggestion engine and an AST-based language model, ASTLan. ASTLan supports the suggestion of the next valid syntactic template and the detection of common syntactic templates. Our empirical evaluation on a large corpus of open-source projects has shown that our engine is more accurate in API code suggestion than the state-of-the-art approaches, and in 75\% of the cases, it can correctly suggest the API with only five candidates. ASTLan also has high accuracy in suggesting the next syntactic template and is able to detect many useful and common syntactic templates.},

We examine the proposed standards to identify the most promising features and report on experiments with a number of adaptive layout mechanisms that support the required forms of adaptation to take advantage of greater screen real estates, such as automated scaling of text and media. Special attention is given to the effective use of multi-column layout, a brand new feature for web design that contributes to optimising the space occupied by text, but at the same time still poses problems in predominantly continuous vertical-scrolling browsing behaviours.

	abstract = {Context: The increased use of Open Source Software (OSS) affects how software-intensive product development organizations (SIPDO) innovate and compete, moving them towards Open Innovation (OI). Specifically, software engineering tools have the potential for OI, but require better understanding regarding what to develop in-ternally and what to acquire from outside the organization, and how to cooperate with potential competitors. Aim: This paper aims at synthesizing a theory of openness for software engineering tools in SIPDOs, that can be utilized by managers in defining more efficient strategies towards OSS communities. Method: We synthesize empirical evidence from a systematic mapping study, a case study, and a survey, using a narrative method. The synthesis method entails four steps: (1) Developing a preliminary synthesis, (2) Exploring the relationship between studies, (3) Assessing the validity of the synthesis, and (4) Theory formation. Result: We present a theory of openness for OSS tools in software engineering in relation to four constructs: (1) Strategy, (2) Triggers, (3) Outcomes, and (4) Level of openness. Conclusion: The theory reasons that openness provides opportunities to reduce the development cost and de-velopment time. Furthermore, OI positively impacts on the process and product innovation, but it requires investment by organizations in OSS communities. By betting on openness, organizations may be able to sig-nificantly increase their competitiveness.},

With the increasing volume of online content in the form of forums, finding relevant information in forums can be a challenging task and knowledge management and quality assurance of this content are of critical importance. Although online discus-sion forums offer search services, in most cases only keyword search is provided. In keyword search techniques, such as cosine similarity, lexical overlap between query and document terms is considered; however, these techniques do not consider the con-text or meaning of the terms, thus failed to retrieve the relevant documents. Earlier content-based research efforts for improving the performance of thread retrieval were primarily based on cosine similarity technique. Cosine similarity technique assigns term-weights based on term-frequency and inverse-document frequency; however, this technique does not consider discussion semantics which may lead to less effective document retrieval. To address these issues, we have proposed two thread ranking tech- A novel framework for social web forums' thread... 4277 niques for online discussion forums: (1) threads are ranked on the basis of a semantic similarity score between posts and (2) threads are ranked based on their participants' reputation and posts' quality.

The study described here took place in 2014 in the context of embedding the teaching of academic writing into anthropology modules. The strategies implemented were microthemes, peer feedback, annotated bibliographies, and, for the sake of introducing blended learning, word clouds. The findings provide an overview of what aspects of each teaching strategy were helpful and which were problematic. In this regard, differences between the perspectives of the anthropology lecturer and the students were revealed, with the lecturer's opinion differing from that of the majority of students regarding peer feedback. The findings should be useful to lecturers who wish to help their students with academic writing, and to academic developers who are responsible for showing staff how to embed the teaching of writing into the disciplines.},

	volume = {95},
	doi = {10.1016/j.infsof.2017.10.015},
	abstract = {Context: Since its inception around 2010, gamification has become one of the top technology and software trends. However, gamification has also been regarded as one of the most challenging areas of software en-gineering. Beyond traditional software design requirements, designing gamification requires the command of disciplines such as (motivational/behavioral) psychology, game design, and narratology, making the develop-ment of gamified software a challenge for traditional software developers. Gamification software inhabits a finely tuned niche of software engineering that seeks for both high functionality and engagement; beyond technical flawlessness, gamification has to motivate and affect users. Consequently, it has also been projected that most gamified software is doomed to fail. Objective: This paper seeks to advance the understanding of designing gamification and to provide a compre-hensive method for developing gamified software. Method: We approach the research problem via a design science research approach; firstly, by synthesizing the current body of literature on gamification design methods and by interviewing 25 gamification experts, pro-ducing a comprehensive list of design principles for developing gamified software. Secondly, and more im-portantly, we develop a detailed method for engineering of gamified software based on the gathered knowledge and design principles. Finally, we conduct an evaluation of the artifacts via interviews of ten gamification ex-perts and implementation of the engineering method in a gamification project. Results: As results of the study, we present the method and key design principles for engineering gamified software. Based on the empirical and expert evaluation, the developed method was deemed as comprehensive, implementable, complete, and useful. We deliver a comprehensive overview of gamification guidelines and shed novel insights into the nature of gamification development and design discourse. Conclusion: This paper takes first steps towards a comprehensive method for gamified software engineering.},

Although the framework is addressed to movies' recommendation and validated in this context it can be easily extended to other domains. It manages different predictive models for making recommendations depending on specific situations.

Choosing the adequate formal process for gamification design has become an important success requirement. This work presents a systematic review of the gamification design frameworks discussed in the literature, providing a useful resource to educational practitioners as well as gamification designers and researchers.

	abstract = {XSL Transformations (XSLT) is a programming language for defining transformations among XML languages. The structure of these languages is formally described by schemas, for example using DTD or XML Schema, which allows individual documents to be validated. However, existing XSLT tools offer no static guarantees that, under the assumption that the input is valid relative to the input schema, the output of the transformation is valid relative to the output schema. We present a validation technique for XSLT based on the XML graph formalism introduced in the static analysis of JWIG Web services and XACT XML transformations. Being able to provide static guarantees, we can detect a large class of errors in an XSLT stylesheet at the time it is written instead of later when it has been deployed, and thereby provide benefits similar to those of static type checkers for modern programming languages. Our analysis takes a pragmatic approach that focuses its precision on the essential language features but still handles the entire XSLT language. We evaluate the analysis precision on a range of real stylesheets and demonstrate how it may be useful in practice.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom has been gaining popularity in recent years. In theory, flipping the classroom appears sound: passive learning activities such as unidirectional lectures are pushed to outside class hours in the form of videos, and precious class time is spent on active learning activities. Yet the courses for information systems (IS) undergraduates at the university that the author is teaching at are still conducted in the traditional lecture-in-class, homework-after-class style. In order to increase students' engagement with the course content and to improve their experience with the course, the author implemented a trial of the flipped classroom model for a programming course with pair programming as the predominant in-class active learning activity. Student feedback on this pedagogy was generally very positive with many respondents considering it effective and helpful for learning. One of the biggest advantages mentioned by students is that they had the option to watch each video lecture as many times as required to be prepared for class. The author also observed that students were more engaged and empowered to take on more ownership for their learning. He recommends that other instructors consider rolling out their own trials of the flipped classroom incrementally for courses that would benefit the most from this pedagogy.

	abstract = {The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a basic communication protocol in Web services, which is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML). SOAP could suffer from high latency and bottlenecks that might occur due to the high network traffic caused by the large number of client requests and the large size of XML Web messages. Previous works have proposed static and dynamic clustering models for SOAP messages to support compression based aggregation tool that could potentially reduce the overall size of SOAP messages in order to reduce the required bandwidth between the clients and their server and increase the performance of Web services. In this paper, dynamic clustering based aggregation model has been implemented based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Euclidean Distance methods for estimating the high degree of similarity among SOAP messages and then grouping them into a dynamic number of clusters based on lower distance to support Huffman compression based aggregation tool in combining several compressed XML Web messages in one compact message. Our proposed model has achieved better results especially in medium and large subsets of used dataset in comparison with dynamic fractal clustering and in medium, large and very large subsets with vector space model that used the same dataset. Moreover, the experiment results show a significant improvement in reducing the required processing time for clustering XML Web messages in each group of dataset.},

There are vari-ous inferences involved in the record-extraction process, including mention detection, unification, and field assignments. We use structured learning to find the appropriate field-value assignments. Unlike previous works, the proposed approach generates feature-rich models that enable the modeling of domain semantics and structural coherence at all levels and across fields. Given labeled examples, such an approach can, for instance, learn likely event durations and the fact that start times should come before end times. While the inference space is large, effective learning is achieved using a perceptron-style method and simple, greedy beam decoding. A main focus of this article is on practical aspects involved in implementing the proposed framework for real-world applications. We argue and demonstrate that this approach is favorable in con-ditions of data shift, a real-world setting in which models learned using a limited set of labeled examples are applied to examples drawn from a different data distribution. Much of the framework's robustness is attributed to the modeling of domain knowledge. We describe design and implementation details for the case study of seminar event extraction from email announcements, and discuss design adaptations across different domains and text genres.

It is inconvenient and inefficient for an ordinary user to invoke multiple search engines and identify useful documents from the returned results.

Metasearch engines have other benefits as a search tool such as increasing the search coverage of the Web and improving the scalability of the search. In this article, we survey techniques that have been proposed to tackle several underlying challenges for building a good metasearch engine. Among the main challenges, the database selection problem is to identify search engines that are likely to return useful documents to a given query. The document selection problem is to determine what documents to retrieve from each identified search engine. The result merging problem is to combine the documents returned from multiple search engines. We will also point out some problems that need to be further researched.},

The authors analysed 39 examiners' reports on 13 PhDs produced over a five-year period by scholars from the Higher Education Research doctoral studies programme at Rhodes University in South Africa. Drawing on aspects of Karl Maton's Legitimation Code Theory (LCT), this study uses the dimensions of LCT:Specialisation and LCT:Semantics to explore what kinds of knowledge, skills and procedures and what kinds of knowers are validated in the field of Higher Education Research through the examination process. The study found that despite concerns in the literature about the a-theoretical nature of the Higher Education Studies field, examiners valued high-level theoretical and meta-theoretical engagement as well as methodological rigour. In addition, examiners prized the ability to demonstrate a strong ideological position, to use a clear doctoral voice, and to recognise the axiological drive of the field. The analysis showed that examiners were interested in strong contextualisation of the problem-spaces in higher education in South Africa but also commented positively on candidates' ability to move from troubling an issue within its context to being able to abstract findings so as to contribute to the field as a whole.},

	title = {In {Context}: {Information} {Architects}, {Politics}, and {Interdisciplinarity}},
	abstract = {This study considers the ongoing development and future trajectory of a particular aspect of new media practice, the information architecture field, focusing specifically on the years 1995-2005. Richard Saul Wurman coined the term “information architect” (IA) in the late 1970s (Knemeyer, 2004 January, p. 3), arguing that just as architects envision and structure buildings with their patrons in mind, individuals can structure information in ways that facilitate its use. IAs are responsible for making information understandable by creating useful classification/navigation schemes that help users find their way through complex libraries of information on the Web. The practicing IA is typically concerned with three domains: content, users, and context (Rosenfeld \& Morville, 2002). IAs juggle these in tandem, attempting to organize content created by the technological organization, the informational goals of the end-product’s users, and the often-unstated technical abilities and cultural assumptions users are working under. IAs and other user-centered designers use a variety of techniques borrowed from fields like anthropology and cognitive science in an attempt to design intuitive systems (Kuniavsky, 2003). This inquiry examines experts’ influence on the discursive development of a professional practice. As such, it extends the work of scholars such as Anthony Giddens (1991), who examined the importance of experts in structuring how and what we think. Three different sets of data comprise my study’s corpus: materials written about IA; postings to an open and unmoderated professional mailing list (SIG-IA); and interviews with experts within the field of IA. Using theoretical approaches drawn from actor-network theory (Callon \& Latour, 1981; Latour, 1988, 1993, 2005) and cultural-historical activity theory (Engeström, 2001; Engeström, Miettinen, \& Punamäki-Gitai, 1999; Kaptelinin \& Nardi, 2006; Nardi, 1996), and using discourse analysis methods outlined by Foucault (1972) and Gee (1999), I illustrate the ways this field has been discursively constructed by experts within it. First, I explore the tensions inherent in the practice of IA and its relation to other disciplines. Then, I examine the assumptions about the nature of intuitive interfaces, users, and the role of ethics in the discourse in the field of IA. Lastly, my study considers the political ramifications of the tools, methods, and rhetorical practices promoted in texts written about the field and the ways its practitioners construct it through professional discourse. I argue that the numerous contradictions contained within the IA activity system potentially threaten its formalization and acceptance within the larger user-centered design community.},

	abstract = {This article considers the problematic relationship between new media designers and users in current texts written about user-centered design (UCD) techniques. To better understand and solidify the importance of the user within the technological artifact, these designers often create 'personas' – prototypical users with names, faces, interests and preferences. Personas serve as boundary objects used as conceptual stand-ins for users when team members make design decisions. This article traces the discursive construction of the 'user' within web design texts and how these texts describe the persona technique. The analysis suggests that the use of personas is motivated as much by political realities within new media organizations, as it is by the desire to address user needs. In addition, it is argued that personas serve to reinscribe the conceptual separation between the user and designer despite technological developments (like Web 2.0) that blur this boundary.},

Abstract Purpose – This paper aims to present the concept of electronic work, such as an e-book integrator of concerns (logical structure, appearance and functionality), for representing literary texts available in electronic heterogeneous environments. Design/methodology/approach – From the generic description of an e-book and the descriptive requirements of the BiDiLiC project, the concept of electronic work is presented. These requirements involve a descriptive markup policy (based on TEI-Lite) which defines the text's logical structure and is used for integrating the other concerns associated with the text: functionality and appearance. Finally, the article presents an example showing the integration of the previous concepts to achieve a functional implementation of the electronic work. Findings – The electronic work covers the requirements of classic literary texts, while still allowing other types of texts to be represented easily. For this purpose, a robust logical structure based on TEI is defined, which offers an interchange norm for information stored in an electronic form. This representation, developed in XML, allows the logical structure of the text to be described generically, facilitating the integration (around it) of the service's functionality, as well as adapting its appearance for use in heterogeneous environments, such as the internet. Originality/value – This paper proposes a new approach for interacting with electronic content. This approach is presented from conceptual basis to functional representation by way of theoretical reasoning and innovative technology.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t The need to store and query a set of strings – a string dictionary – arises in many kinds of applications. While classically these string dictionaries have accounted for a small share of the total space budget (e.g., in Natural Language Processing or when indexing text col-lections), recent applications in Web engines, Semantic Web (RDF) graphs, Bioinformatics, and many others handle very large string dictionaries, whose size is a significant fraction of the whole data. In these cases, string dictionary management is a scalability issue by itself. This paper focuses on the problem of managing large static string dictionaries in compressed main memory space. We revisit classical solutions for string dictionaries like hashing, tries, and front-coding, and improve them by using compression techniques. We also introduce some novel string dictionary representations built on top of recent advances in succinct data structures and full-text indexes. All these structures are empirically compared on a heterogeneous testbed formed by real-world string diction-aries. We show that the compressed representations may use as little as 5\% of the original dictionary size, while supporting lookup operations within a few microseconds. These numbers outperform the state-of-the-art space/time tradeoffs in many cases. Further-more, we enhance some representations to provide prefix-and substring-based searches, which also perform competitively. The results show that compressed string dictionaries are a useful building block for various data-intensive applications in different domains.},

Though some of them are technological, the majority are related with the need to compose different and, many times, unrelated design concerns which may be functional as in the case of most of the specific application's requirements, or non-functional such as Accessibility itself. In this paper, we present a novel approach to conceive, design and develop Accessible Web applications in an aspect-oriented manner. In order to reach our goal, we provide some modeling techniques that we specifically developed for handling the non-functional, generic and crosscutting characteristics of the Accessibility concerns. Specifically, we have enriched User Interaction Diagrams with integration points, which are used to reason and document Accessibility for activity modeling during user interface design. Then by instantiating a Softgoal Interdependency Graph template with association tables, we work on an abstract interface model (composed by ontology widgets) to obtain a concrete and accessible interface model for the Web application being developed. We use a real application example to illustrate our ideas and point out the advantages of a clear separation of concerns throughout the development life-cycle. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t This study investigated the extent and nature of university students' use of digital technologies for learning and socialising. The findings show that students use a limited range of mainly established technologies. Use of collaborative knowledge creation tools, virtual worlds, and social networking sites was low. 'Digital natives' and students of a technical discipline (Engineering) used more technology tools when compared to 'digital immigrants' and students of a non-technical discipline (Social Work). This relationship may be mediated by the finding that Engineering courses required more intensive and extensive access to technology than Social Work courses. However, the use of technology between these groups is only quantitatively rather than qualitatively different. The study did not find evidence to support popular claims that young people adopt radically different learning styles. Their attitudes to learning appear to be influenced by lecturers' teaching approaches. Students appear to conform to traditional pedagogies, albeit with minor uses of tools delivering content. The outcomes suggest that although the calls for transformations in education may be legitimate it would be misleading to ground the arguments for such change in students' shifting patterns of learning and technology use.},

	abstract = {The basic principles of a flipped classroom teaching method are to deliver content outside of the class and to move active learning into the classroom. There are many strategies for delivering the content online, such as having instructors prepare online lectures, wrapping the course around a MOOC, and curating online videos from various sources. There are also many strategies for including active learning in the classroom that go beyond providing programming labs, and can include various forms of peer instruction. In this paper we describe our experiences flipping four different computer science classes across multiple semesters over two years. This breadth of experience with classroom flipping has enabled us to compare strategies and approaches and develop an understanding of which approaches appear to work under which circumstances. We discuss how we structured out-of-class preparatory work, how we created or sourced online videos, how we used active learning activities in-class to scaffold skills development and identify students' misconceptions, and how we structured teams for in class activities. This paper contributes a set of flexible strategies to consider for provision of curricular content out-of-class, structuring students' preparatory work, applying active learning of skills and concepts, and leveraging social interaction and peer instruction for CS education. We present the impact of our approaches based upon leading indicators of course evaluations and student surveys. We discuss lessons learned and students' responses to our strategies.},

In this paper, we propose a set of novel techniques to address this problem. While several previous works have addressed the same problem, most of them require multiple input pages while our method requires only one. In addition, previous methods make some assumptions about how data records are encoded into web pages, which do not always hold in real websites. Finally, we have also tested our techniques with a high number of real web sources and we have found them to be very effective.},

Our algorithm breaks scalabil-ity barriers in the method of Chu et al. (1999) by abandoning adaptive cooling based on variance. The resulting gains in parallel efficiency are much larger than the loss of serial efficiency from lack of adaptive cooling. Our algorithm resamples the states across proces-sors periodically. The resampling interval is tuned according to the success rate for each specific number of processors. We further present an adaptive method to determine the resampling interval based on the adoption rate. This adaptive method is able to achieve nearly identical parallel efficiency but higher success rates compared to the fixed interval one using the best interval found.},

As a pervasive form of artistic expression through ages and media, drama features a twofold nature of its tangible manifestations (theatrical performances, movies, books, etc.) and its intangible abstraction (the story of Cinderella underlying Disney movie and Perrault's fable). The encoding of the intangible drama abstraction of drama documents is relevant for the preservation of cultural heritage and the didactics and research on drama documents. This paper addresses the task of encoding the notion of intangible story abstraction from the drama documents. The reference model is provided by a computational ontology that formally encodes the elements that characterize a drama, for purposes of semantic linking and inclusion in annotation schemata. By providing a formal expression posited between drama as work and its manifestations, the ontology-based representation is compliant with the model of Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR).},

	title = {Correlation of {Software} {Quality} {Metrics} and {Performance}},
	abstract = {Performance is an aspect of software quality that is often not considered at early stages of software design. Common approaches to performance analysis include utilizing profiling tools after the software has been developed to find bottlenecks and executing simulation models that are either manually constructed or derived from UML design diagrams. Many projects attempt to correct performance issues by adding more powerful hardware instead of attacking the root cause. Software metrics have been used to predict many aspects of software quality such as maintainability and fault-tolerance by correlation and regression analysis. Metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer, also known as the CK metric suite, have been studied extensively in software quality model analyses. These studies examined maintainability, fault tolerance, error proneness, and scalability of the software as it evolved through time. Correlations were made between metrics and the likely quality models they represented. Other metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity by McCabe and class couplings by Martin have also been used in quality predictions. No research has been conducted to analyze relationship between performance and metrics. The goal of this research was to construct a decision tree that used software metrics to forecast performance characteristics. The relationship between metrics and performance was derived by correlation between static code metrics and three runtime variables: number of objects, method call frequency, and average method call lengths on selected software benchmarks. The decision tree was constructed using the C4.5 algorithm implemented in the WEKA software. Pearson correlation coefficients were obtained for the combined datasets from all benchmarks. The decision trees and Pearson statistics showed that weighted methods per class (WMC), total lines of code (TLOC), and coupling between objects (CBO) have significant correlation with software performance. WMC showed positive correlation with number of objects and calls. CBO correlated positively with average method call lengths and negatively with number of objects. TLOC correlated positively with number of calls.},

We therefore write this commentary to call upon information systems scholars to investigate the design and use of gamified information systems from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theories, including behavioral economics, psychology, social psychology, information systems, etc. We first explicate the idea of gamified information systems, provide real-world examples of successful and unsuccessful systems, and, based on a synthesis of the available literature, present a taxonomy of gamification design elements. We then develop a framework for research and design: its main theme is to create meaningful engagement for users; that is, gamified information systems should be designed to address the dual goals of instrumental and experiential outcomes. Using this framework, we develop a set of design principles and research questions, using a running case to illustrate some of our ideas. We conclude with a summary of opportunities for IS researchers to extend our knowledge of gamified information systems, and, at the same time, advance existing theories.},

Due to the fast-moving of nodes in AANET/UAS, the topology changes frequently. The routing overhead becomes huge and inefficient, and connectivity keeping becomes difficult. In this paper, a shortest path routing algorithm based on grid position no center(GPNC-SP algorithm) is pro-posed, which uses the logical grid distance to replace the original Euclidean distance to reduce the sensitivity of fast-moving nodes. This algorithm automatically computes and maintains the adjacency relationship and topology structure by perception and updat-ing algorithm and adopts Dijkstra algorithm to achieve the shortest routing path. Also, a regional reconstruction strategy(RSS) is designed to optimize the routing path dynamically. At the same time, two metrics, i.e., the percentage of the effective communi-cation area(P eca \%) and the sensitivity with logical grid size (S g) are used to determine the optional scope of logical grid width. Comparing with the two traditional typical routing protocols (DREAM and DSDV algorithms), this algorithm sacrifices a certain degree of communication distance to achieve better performances of network overhead, link stability, and calculating speed. The final simulation experiments under the Matlab environment demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of this algorithm.},

In this paper we show the Lecomps5 system, a didactic framework, supporting the automated production and adaptation of personalized courses, implemented in the Lecomps5 system. In particular, this framework was designed in order to address the teacher's satisfaction issue, arising in many systems that are quite demanding in terms of the teacher's work and range of activities. Lecomps5 allows the teacher, through a simple and intuitive didactic tool, to define learning material, specify its characteristics pertaining to personalization and define, to some extent, the didactic strategies to be applied. In order to support both the management of learning material and the automated construc-tion of personalized courses, the system embeds a planner, based on Linear Temporal Logic. The selection of learning material, its sequencing, and the delivery of courses, is performed according to both learners' initial and run-time knowledge and learning styles. The teacher can focus more on her didactic tasks and preferences rather than on the available authoring tools, and spend less time to generate courses. Finally we show encouraging results from experimentation we conducted to test the system from a teacher's point of view.},

Accordingly, microcontroller-based operating sys-tems have not provided important features like fault isolation, dynamic memory allocation, and flexible concurrency. How-ever, an emerging class of embedded applications are software platforms, rather than single purpose devices, and need these multiprogramming features. Tock, a new operating system for low-power platforms, takes advantage of limited hardware-protection mechanisms as well as the type-safety features of the Rust programming language to provide a multipro-gramming environment for microcontrollers. Tock isolates software faults, provides memory protection, and efficiently manages memory for dynamic application workloads written in any language. It achieves this while retaining the depend-ability requirements of long-running applications.},

Moreover, utilizing a type-safe language with no garbage collector or other runtime services avoids what would otherwise be some of the largest sections of trusted code base. We report on our experiences in writing a resource efficient embedded kernel in Rust, finding that only a small set of unsafe abstractions are necessary in order to form common kernel building blocks. Further, we argue that Rust's choice to avoid runtime memory management by using a linear type system will enable the next generation of safe operating systems.},

The distinguishing contribution of the approach is a novel method to generate classification fea-tures. The features are extracted from charts, compilations of elements from various annotation layers, such as word tran-scriptions, syntactic and semantic parses, and information extraction (IE) annotations. We describe a procedure for creating charts from documents and queries, while paying special attention to query slots (free-text descriptions of names, organizations, topic, events and so on, around which templates are centered), and suggest various types of classification features that can be extracted from these charts. While observing a 30\% relative improvement due to non-lexical annota-tion layers, we perform a detailed analysis of the contributions of each of these layers to classification performance.},

	abstract = {Planning the complex product design process is critical for the successful production and distribution of marketable products. Despite its importance, however, many members of industry are seemingly indifferent to the planning activity besides that which occurs in relation to their own responsibilities. However, understanding the complexity of the products being designed suggests a requirement for many project stakeholders from multiple functional responsibilities to work synchronously to ensure the success of a complex product design project. Much of the research conducted around the complex product design process alludes to the importance of planning but is more limited regarding how industry actually applies their embedded planning systems to conduct complex product design process planning activities. This thesis describes research conducted to determine industry’s comprehensive planning activity for the complex product design process from a project perspective. It systematically discusses the literature review and ensuing empirical case studies that were pursued to answer the research questions identified and satisfy the objectives of the research. In identifying how industry plans its design process, it suggests opportunities for improvement and introduces a modelling technique to effect such improvement. The thesis concludes by summarising the contributions that were made and proposing future research opportunities to build upon the work that was initiated and embarked upon with this research project.},

Questionnaire responses and online monitoring of student's access to recordings indicate that w75\% students use this material, the majority in a targeted manner. In contrast, a small subset of students (w5\%) are highly dependent on recordings downloading every lecture, and viewing the material for long periods, such that this repre-sents a large proportion of their independent study. This 'high user' group is atypical, as it contains a high proportion of dyslexic and Non-English Speaking Background students. Despite high usage, lecture recordings do not have a significant impact on academic performance, either across the cohort or with students that use the recordings. Overall, this approach appears to be beneficial, but may reduce lecture attendance and encourage surface learning approaches in a minority of students.},

	abstract = {In today’s globalised and fast-paced world it can be important for manufacturing companies of high tech products to introduce innovations ahead of their competitors. This pressure is put on the development and design process of products too. Effective project planning and management of engineering design processes is a key to timely product delivery. One way to support project planning and management is process modelling. Many process modelling and simulation approaches can be found in engineering design and management literature. However, these approaches are found to be insufficient for modelling iteration-related aspects in engineering design processes: they are not capable of capturing all relevant iteration-related characteristics, i.e., its causes and effects as well as their dynamic relationships, and, at the same time, addressing planning issues related to process structure and project environment in iteration management. Hence, existing modelling approaches may not be able to support iteration management effectively. A Transformation-Based Model Integration Framework was developed to alleviate some of these limitations. This framework employs two popular modelling approaches: activity-based and System Dynamics modelling. The model integration method of this framework was designed to be applicable to already-built activity- based models in order to enable the analysis of process structural details captured in activity-based models in a simulation modelling environment where process dynamics can be added. The developed framework can explicitly capture a wide range of causes and effects of iteration, which in turn can facilitate explanatory and exploratory simulation analyses to investigate iteration behaviour and address planning issues related to both process structure and project environment.},

Current automatic wrappers are complicated because they take into consideration the problems of locating relevant data region using visual cues and the use of complicated algorithms to check the similarity of data records. In this paper, we develop a non-visual automatic wrapper which questions the need for complex visual based wrappers in data extraction. The novel techniques for our wrapper are (1) filtering rules to detect and filter out irrelevant data records, (2) a tree matching algorithm using frequency measures to increase the speed of data extraction, (3) an algorithm to calculate the number and size of the components of data records to detect the correct data region, (4) a data alignment algorithm which is able to align iterative (repetitive HTML command tags) and disjunctive (optional) data items and (5) a data merging and partitioning method to solve the imperfect segmentation problem (the prob-lem of correctly identifying the atomic entities in data items). Results show that our wrap-per is as robust and in many cases outperforms the state of the art wrappers such as ViNT and DEPTA. This wrapper could have significant speed advantages when processing large volumes of web sites data, which could be helpful in meta search engine development.},

Based on this "XML Data Standards Map", a multi-faceted classification mechanism is proposed, leading to an extensible taxonomy of standards. A set of facets is analyzed for each standard, allowing for their classification based on their scope, completeness, compatibility with other standards, openness, ability to modify the schemas and maturity, to name a few. Through populating and querying this multi-faceted classification, a common understanding of Data Integration Standards can be ensured and the choice of a standard according to the requirements of each business can be systematically addressed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The truth is that this process often involves a lot of trial- and-error because multiple versions of subtitle documents have distinct synchronization references, given that they are targeted at variations of the same audiovisual content. Building on our previous efforts to address this problem, in this paper we formalize and validate a two-phase subtitle synchronization framework. The benefit over current approaches lays in the usage of audio fingerprint annotations generated from the base audio signal as second-level synchronization anchors. This way, we allow the media player to dynamically fix during playback the most common cases of subtitle synchronization misalignment that compromise users' watching experience. Results from our evaluation process indicate that our framework has minimal impact on existing subtitle documents and formats as well as on the playback performance.},

	abstract = {On today's Web, designers take huge efforts to create visually rich websites that boast a magnitude of interactive elements. Contrarily, most web information extraction (WIE) algorithms are still based on attributed tree methods which struggle to deal with this complexity. In this paper, we introduce a versatile model to represent web documents. The model is based on gestalt theory principles - trying to capture the most important aspects in a formally exact way. It (i) represents and unifies access to visual layout, content and functional aspects; (ii) is implemented with semantic web techniques that can be leveraged for i.e. automatic reasoning. Considering the visual appearance of a web page, we view it as a collection of gestalt figures -based on gestalt primitives - -each representing a specific design pattern, be it navigation menus or news articles. Based on this model, we introduce our WIE methodology, a re-engineering process involving design patterns, statistical distributions and text content properties. The complete framework consists of the UOM model, which formalizes the mentioned components, and the MANM layer that hints on structure and serialization, providing document re-packaging foundations. Finally, we discuss how we have applied and evaluated our model in the area of web accessibility. © 2011 ACM.},

	abstract = {In contemporary literary studies, the term ekphrasis refers almost exclusively to a poem created by a poet looking at a painting. In the visual arts and music it is used more broadly to describe intermedial creative processes where, for example, a painting is inspired by a piece of music, or the composition of a piece of music is inspired by a poem. The ekphrasis concept is based on the ancient Greek ε῎κwρασις, which were rhetorical ‘description’ exercises considered important for developing written and perceptual skills. This article considers the gradual recognition by creative writers, and especially novelists, that ekphrasis is a key aspect of their practice. It examines the original purpose of ekphrasis as a rhetorical exercise, then considers how this was interpreted in the time of the first novel writers. It assesses how a technology that changed the way we see – photography – influenced prose writing in the modern era. It looks at how neuroscience and cognitive psychology have attempted to explain what goes on in our minds when we do ekphrasis. And it reports on what writers themselves have said about their visualising techniques. Overall, this article analyses ekphrasis as a key element in the creative writing process.},

However, with the intensification of academic workload, academic managers might not view the support of off-campus PhD students as a high priority. This study investigates the attitudes of middle managers in a large Australian university concerning the provision of training and support to offcampus PhD students.

We analyze the current practice of semi-semantic markup in L A T E X docu-ments and extend it by a markup infrastructure that allows to embed semantic annotations into L A T E X documents without changing their visual appearance. This collection of T E X macro packages is called sT E X (semantic T E X) as it al-lows to markup L A T E X documents semantically without leaving the time-tried T E X/L A T E X workflow, essentially turning L A T E X into an MKM format. At the heart of sT E X is a definition mechanism for semantic macros for mathematical objects and a non-standard scoping construct for them, which is oriented at the semantic dependency relation rather than the document structure. We evaluate the sT E X macro collection on a large case study: the course materials of a two-semester course in Computer Science was annotated se-mantically and converted to the OMDoc MKM format by Bruce Miller's LaTeXML system.

Additionally, it did not cause exam anxiety. Apart from these positive opinions, some learners complained about the visibility of the leader board during assessment and the presence of locked levels. It is believed that this study will serve as a model since it involves a detailed gamified assessment design that is in line with theoretical foundations and contains various gamification components, such as avatars, levels, content unlocking, the leader board, achievements, virtual goods, points, teams, and badges.},

Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews.

The research aims to identify, from the supervisor's perspective, any particular learning challenges that such candidates might face. The analysis identifies three specific issues of concern to the supervisors: candidates who commence candidature already 'knowing the answer'; candidates who want to answer the question from personal experience rather than the analysis of their data; and candidates who lose interest when confronted by the need to address traditional protocols and approaches to research.

This paper describes some of our attempts at building markup tools, lessons learned, and our latest markup tool, the Semantic Markup Tool (SMT). SMT uses automatic text extractors and templates to hide ontological complexity from end users and helps them quickly specify events and relationships of interest in the document.

	abstract = {In the current research-focused climate, academics are facing increasing pressure to produce research outputs. This pressure can prove particularly daunting for early career (EC) academics, who are simultaneously attempting to master new teaching and administrative demands while establishing their own independent research trajectories. Previous reports suggest that academic writing retreats can be an effective way of increasing research outputs. Such retreats generally involve academics from a range of career stages and require expert facilitators. Through organising a series of structured writing events, this project aims to cultivate an enduring community of practice for academic writers. Reflecting on our EC retreat and subsequent writing days with academics from different career stages, we suggest that success hinged on three key factors: (1) A formal structure comprising bounded periods of intense writing, flanked by group reviewing and goal-setting; (2) Co-located writing with participants based in a shared space, away from their usual workstation and distractions; (3) Peer discussions involving participants at a similar career stage. Specifically we found that writing amongst 'equals' increased productivity and confidence amongst EC academics.},

This paper addresses these challenges and outlines an approach to teaching narrative persona in the creative nonfiction classroom.

Amongst a variety of approaches, adaptation aspects are a well-known solution to signi cantly improve SoC in adaptive hypermedia applications. To model adaptation aspects in XML-based hypermedia applications, we developed PX-Weave, a tool which allows to specify and weave such aspects in multi-staged XML transformation environments. However, while aspects increase modularity and thus decrease complexity of software, they do also introduce some complex problems. The most prominent one, aspect interaction, has received a lot of attention from researchers during the last decade. In this paper we investigate the problem of aspect interaction for adaptation aspects. We present a combined approach for static and dynamic detection of aspect interactions in multi-staged XML-based hypermedia applications, which we implemented as an add-on to PX-Weave.},

	abstract = {One of the key issues in large-scale distributed systems such as P2P and grids is the capability of efficient multidimensional range query processing. Although several methods have recently been proposed for solving this problem on distributed systems, these methods have not been able to meet the fundamental necessity of a typical method on large-scale distributed systems, i.e., scalability. This paper presents Fractal, a fully decentralized and highly scalable multidimensional range query lookup protocol for distributed systems. In this work, to organize the available nodes in the system, an n-dimensional space called Key Space is utilized. The available nodes on the nested Fractal rings maintain information about only O(logN) other nodes, and the Fractal lookup protocol discovers the destination node through these nested rings with a logarithmic cost. Because of its flexibility, Fractal allows the system to create a concept called Layering, which minimizes the probability of the wide-area message transfers (WAMTs) during the lookup process. Using several criteria, Fractal is compared with several successful methods that have recently been presented. Simulation results show the efficiency and performance of Fractal in networks of different sizes.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-13-S1-S5},
	abstract = {Background: Ontologies are being developed for the life sciences to standardise the way we describe and interpret the wealth of data currently being generated. As more ontology based applications begin to emerge, tools are required that enable domain experts to contribute their knowledge to the growing pool of ontologies. There are many barriers that prevent domain experts engaging in the ontology development process and novel tools are needed to break down these barriers to engage a wider community of scientists. Results: We present Populous, a tool for gathering content with which to construct an ontology. Domain experts need to add content, that is often repetitive in its form, but without having to tackle the underlying ontological representation. Populous presents users with a table based form in which columns are constrained to take values from particular ontologies. Populated tables are mapped to patterns that can then be used to automatically generate the ontology's content. These forms can be exported as spreadsheets, providing an interface that is much more familiar to many biologists. Conclusions: Populous's contribution is in the knowledge gathering stage of ontology development; it separates knowledge gathering from the conceptualisation and axiomatisation, as well as separating the user from the standard ontology authoring environments. Populous is by no means a replacement for standard ontology editing tools, but instead provides a useful platform for engaging a wider community of scientists in the mass production of ontology content.

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Digital textbook analytics are a new method of collecting student-generated data in order to build predictive models of student success. Previous research using self-report or laboratory measures of reading show that en-gagement with the textbook was related to student learning outcomes. We hypothesized that an engagement index based on digital textbook usage data would predict student course grades. Linear regression analyses were conducted using data from 233 students to determine whether digital textbook usage metrics predicted final course grades. A calculated linear index of textbook usage metrics was significantly predictive of final course grades and was a stronger predictor of course outcomes than previous academic achievement. However, time spent reading, one of the variables that make up the index was more strongly predictive of course outcomes. Additionally, students who were in the top 10th percentile in number of highlights had significantly higher course grades than those in the lower 90th percentile. These findings suggest that digital textbook analytics are an effective early warning system to identify students at risk of academic failure. These data can be collected unobtrusively and automatically and provide stronger prediction of outcomes than prior academic achievement (which to this point has been the single strongest predictor of student success).},

	abstract = {The means of producing information and the infrastructure for disseminating it are constantly changing. The web mobilizes information in electronic formats, making it easier to copy, modify, remix, and redistribute. This has changed how information is produced, distributed, and used. People are not just consuming information; they are actively producing, remixing, and sharing information, using the web as a platform for creativity and production. This is true of software development as well. It is frequently commented by programmers and researchers who study software development, that programmers frequently copy and paste code. Although this practice is widely acknowledged, it is rarely studied directly, or explicitly accounted for in models of software development. However, this attitude is changing as software becomes more ubiquitous, and software development practice shifts away from the formal models of software engineering, towards a post-modernist perspective. This study explores how source code snippets in programming books and on the web are changing software development practice. By examining program source code using clone detection algorithms, this study provides a comprehensive view of code copying across 6,190 PHP-language applications. These data are used to explore the concept of a “remix” method of software production, where software and systems are built out of copied and pasted snippets of code. These findings are contrasted against both traditional models of information production coming from informetrics (e.g., authorship, citation analysis), and models from software engineering (e.g., the Lego Hypothesis). Explanations for observed phenomena are discussed borrowing metaphors from linguistics, which provide a richer explanation of copy-paste programming than offered by the Lego Hypothesis. The focus and findings of this study ultimately point to a pressing demand for further research centered on the notion of software as information. Software and software repositories hold a large amount of information about how it was produced, and how it is used, adapted, and maintained. Software informatics is proposed as an organizing label to study the science of information, practice, and communication around software. It studies the individual, collaborative, and social aspects of software production and use, spanning multiple representations of software from design, to source code, to application.},

We explain that the literature review is a written product; the format varies depending on the purpose of the review. In most instances, the review will be part of a research project and dissertation, but it can be a stand-alone review, one that is not a chapter in a research dissertation or thesis. We are interested in the process of creating a review. Much more attention has been focused on improving the quality of literature reviews, as awareness of the systematic review protocol, with a defined methodology, has raised expectations of what can be achieved by all of us when reviewing literature. Since the promotion of systematic review as a specialist review in the fields of evidence-based practice, which uses a prescribed, systematic methodologi-cal approach, we have an alternative way to review the literature. The system-atic review produces an output – for example, a statement of findings to inform policy development – that may not necessarily lead into new research. The aim of this opening chapter is to present an overview focusing on the context of doing a literature review. We consider some scenarios when you might undertake a review of literature. There is a short discussion of the relationship between a research question and a research project. Literature review is a library or desk-based method involving the secondary analysis of explicit knowledge, so abstract concepts of explicit and tacit knowledge are explored.

The derivation takes advantages of naming and structural similarities among DTDs in similar domains. The complete approach consists of three main steps. (1) DTD clustering clusters DTDs in similar domains into classes. (2) Schema learner applies a tree grammar inference techniques to generate a set of tree grammar rules from the DTDs in a class from the previous step, (3) Minimizer optimizes the rules generated in the previously step, transforms them into an integrated view, and generates source descriptions. We have implemented the approach into a system called DEEP and tested the system on several domains. Experimental results reveal that this system can effectively and efficiently integrate radically different DTDs.},

	abstract = {Purpose - To provide a selective bibliography in the emerging area of library content personalization for the benefit of library and information professionals. Design/methodology/approach - A range of recently published works (in the period 1993-2004), which aim to provide pragmatic application of content personalization rather than theoretical works, are discussed and sorted into "classified" sections to help library professionals understand more about the various options for formulating content as per the specific needs of their clientele. Findings - This paper provides information about each category of tool and technique of personalization, indicating what is achieved and how particular developments can help other libraries or professionals. It recognises that personalization of library resources is a viable way of helping users deal with the information explosion, conserving their time for more productive intellectual tasks. It identifies how computer and information technology has enabled document mapping to be more efficient, especially because of the ease with which a document can be indexed and represented with multiple terms, and confirms that this same functionality can be used to represent a user's interests, facilitating the easy linking of relevant sources to prospective users. Personalization of library resources is an effective way for maximizing user benefit. Research limitations/implications - This is not an exhaustive list of developments in personalization. Rather it identifies a mix of products and solutions that are of immediate use to librarians. Practical implications - A very useful source of pragmatic applications of personalization so far, that can guide a practicing professional interested in creating similar solutions for more productive information support in his/her library. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for a "review of technology" for LIS practitioners and offers practical help to any professional exploring solutions similar to those outlined in this paper.},

	abstract = {Identifying educational competencies for the 21 st workplace is driven by the need to mitigate disparities between classroom learning and the requirements of workplace environments. Multiple descriptors of desired 21 st century skill sets have been identified through various wide-scale studies (e.g., International Commission on Education for the 21st Century) and consistently within the context of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning, the ability to problem solve, particularly complex problem-solving, remains a crucial competency. In this paper, we look at how current contemporary spaces such as the immensely popular, massively multiplayer online role-playing game(MMORPG), World of Warcraft, (WoW) afford problem-solving skill acquisition in the context of Singaporean youth learners. Given that WoW exists as a contextual space with an overarching narrativized problem to be solved, our investigation focused on two important related constructs that underpin learners' problem-solving trajectory—learning and identity becoming within contemporary domains of technology learning. We present findings of an ethnographic investigation of one youth gamer within the affinity spaces of WoW. Moving away from traditional mentalistic construals of problem-solving, our findings indicate that problem-solving within WoW may be characterized by a triadic-D model of domain, disquisitional, and discursive practices within self, social, and structural dialectics. Theoretical considerations for broadening the understanding of a situated and embodied notion of problem-solving and identity becoming within STEM learning are proposed.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the use of a natural language pro-cessing technique that automatically detects project-specific code templates (i.e., frequently used code blocks), which can be made available to software developers within an inte-grated development environment. During software devel-opment, programmers often and in some cases unknowingly rewrite the same code block that represents some function-ality. These frequently used code blocks can inform the existence and possible use of code templates. Many exist-ing code editors support code templates, but programmers are expected to manually define these templates and subse-quently add them as templates in the editor. Furthermore, the support of editors to provide templates based on the editing context is still limited. The use of n-gram language models within the context of software development is de-scribed and evaluated to overcome these restrictions. The technique can search for project-specific code templates and present these templates to the programmer based on the current editing context.},

Unfortunately no sophistication is spent for these lists: monolithic pieces of text where it is even difficult to tell automatically the authors, the title and publication details, and where users are provided with no mechanisms to filter and access full context of each citation. For instance, there is no way to know in which sentence a work was cited (the citation context) and why (the citation function).

Abstract Purpose – To propose an assessment framework that can be used to categorise and assess commercial web sites from the perspective of web-technological features and functions and to demonstrate its usefulness. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on prior relevant research and successful web site design experiences of industrial experts in the field, an assessment framework that can be used to categorise and assess web features and functions is proposed, and 252 commercial web sites of listed Australian companies were randomly sampled and assessed to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed assessment framework. Findings – The proposed assessment framework provides valuable insights. While different companies normally use different web-technological features and functions on their web sites, certain features and functions have been more commonly used in designing commercial web sites than others, and certain differences in the use of web features and functions on commercial web sites exist across different industries. Research limitations/implications – This research studied commercial web sites of Australian companies. Possible differences in the use of web features and functions on commercial web sites across different countries remain to be explored. Originality/value – Although various approaches have been proposed in previous studies to evaluate commercial web sites, no prior research could be found to assess commercial web sites from the perspective of web-technological features and functions. This research proposed an assessment framework that can be used to categorise and assess commercial web sites from the perspective of web-technological features and functions and demonstrated its usefulness. It also provided valuable insights to commercial web site owners and designers.},

Additionally, the heterogeneous markup document transcoding (HMDT) platform, based on the proposed hybrid transcoding and web services technologies, is also presented to serve as a transcoding service broker to facilitate interoperability between distributed heterogeneous transcoders.

	doi = {10.1016/j.infsof.2017.09.002},
	abstract = {Context: A code smell indicates a poor implementation choice that often worsens software quality. Thus, code smell detection is an elementary technique to identify refactoring opportunities in software systems. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge on how similar two or more developers detect smells in code. In particular, few studies have investigated if developers agree or disagree when recognizing a smell and which factors can influence on such (dis)agreement. Objective: We perform a broader study to investigate how similar the developers detect code smells. We also analyze whether certain factors related to the developers' profiles concerning background and expe-rience may influence such (dis)agreement. Moreover, we analyze if the heuristics adopted by developers on detecting code smells may influence on their (dis)agreement. Method: We conducted an empirical study with 75 developers who evaluated instances of 15 different code smell types. For each smell type, we analyzed the agreement among the developers and we assessed the influence of 6 different factors on the developers' evaluations. Altogether more than 2700 evaluations were collected, resulting in substantial quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: The results indicate that the developers presented a low agreement on detecting all 15 smell types analyzed in our study. The results also suggest that factors related to background and experience did not have a consistent influence on the agreement among the developers. On the other hand, the re-sults show that the agreement was consistently influenced by specific heuristics employed by developers. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that the developers detect code smells in significantly different ways. As a consequence, these findings introduce some questions concerning the results of previous studies that did not consider the different perceptions of developers on detecting code smells. Moreover, our findings shed light towards improving state-of-the-art techniques for accurate, customized detection of code smells.},

This study examined the cognitive load and learning effectiveness of video lectures in terms of the type of knowledge being taught (declarative or procedural) and instructor visibility. Video lectures with and without an instructor were used to teach each type of knowledge. Sixty Chinese undergraduates were randomly assigned to two of the four lectures. They completed a cognitive load questionnaire and learning tests after viewing the lectures. The results of t-tests revealed that adding the instructor in a video lecture increased learners' cognitive load only when learning procedural knowledge; adding the instructor only facilitated declarative knowledge learning. The results suggest that the learning effectiveness of video lectures varies depending on the type of knowledge being taught and the presence or absence of an instructor.},

	abstract = {A test harness, in automated test generation, defines the set of valid tests for a system, as well as their cor-rectness properties. The difficulty of writing test harnesses is a major obstacle to the adoption of automated test generation and model checking. Languages for writing test harnesses are usually tied to a particular tool and unfamiliar to program-mers, and often limit expressiveness. Writing test harnesses directly in the language of the software under test (SUT) is a tedious, repetitive, and error-prone task, offers little or no support for test case manipulation and debugging, and produces hard-to-read, hard-to-maintain code. Using exist-ing harness languages or writing directly in the language of the SUT also tends to limit users to one algorithm for test generation, with little ability to explore alternative meth-ods. In this paper, we present TSTL, the template scripting testing language, a domain-specific language (DSL) for writ-ing test harnesses. TSTL compiles harness definitions into an interface for testing, making generic test generation and manipulation tools for all SUTs possible. TSTL includes tools for generating, manipulating, and analyzing test cases, including simple model checkers. This paper motivates TSTL via a large-scale testing effort, directed by an end-user, to find faults in the most widely used geographic informa- tion systems tool. This paper emphasizes a new approach to automated testing, where, rather than focus on developing a monolithic tool to extend, the aim is to convert a test har-ness into a language extension. This approach makes testing not a separate activity to be performed using a tool, but as natural to users of the language of the system under test as is the use of domain-specific libraries such as ArcPy, NumPy, or QIIME, in their domains. TSTL is a language and tool infrastructure, but is also a way to bring testing activities under the control of an existing programming language in a simple, natural way.},

The investigation of the documents has been conducted in three successive interdisciplinary projects. The team involved in the projects consists of philologists, chemists and computer scientists specialized in the field of digital image processing. The manuscripts investigated are partially degraded since they have been infected by mold, are corrupted by background clutter or contain faded-out or even erased writings. Since these degradations impede a transcription by scholars and worsen the performance of automated document image analysis techniques, the documents have been imaged with a portable multispectral imaging system. By using this non-invasive investigation technique, the contrast of the faded out characters can be increased, compared to ordinary white light illumination. Post-processing techniques, such as dimension reduction tools, can be used to gain a further legibility increase. The resulting images are used as a basis for further document analysis methods. These methods have been especially designed for the historical documents investigated and involve Optical Character Recognition and writer identification. This paper presents an overview on selected methods that have been developed in the projects.},

GBTG was introduced to generate source code for testing compilers from context-free grammars specifying language syntax. More recently, GBTG has been applied to many other testing problems, including the generation of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents and the generation of packets for testing communications protocols. Recent research has shown how to integrate covering-array techniques such as pairwise testing into GBTG tools. While the integration offers considerable power to the tester, there are few practical demonstrations in the literature. We present two case studies showing how to use grammars and covering arrays for automated software testing. The first case study exposes HTML injec-tion vulnerabilities in an RSS feed parser. The second case study determines the effectiveness of network firewalls when faced with TCP flag attacks. The case studies illustrate the use of covering arrays in a GBTG context, the use of visualization to understand large test logs, and the issues and tradeoffs in the design of fully automated GBTG test suites.},

	abstract = {—Tools are an essential part of every software engineering project. But the number of tools that are used in all phases of the software development life-cycle and their complexity is growing continually. Consequently, the setup and maintenance of current tool chains and development environments requires much effort and consumes a lot of time. One approach to counter this, is to employ web-based systems for development tasks, because centralized systems simplify the administration and the deployment of new features. But desktop IDEs play an important role in software development projects today, and will not be replaced entirely by web-based environments in the near future. Therefore, supporting a mixture of hosted tools and tools integrated into desktop IDEs is a sensible approach. In this paper, we present the SSELab, a framework for web-based project portals that attempts to migrate more software development tools from desktop to server environments, but still allows their integration into modern desktop IDEs. It supports the deployment of tools as hosted services using plug-in systems on the server-side. Additionally, it provides access to these tools by a set of clients that can be used in different contexts, either from the command line, from within IDEs such as Eclipse, or from web pages. In the paper, we discuss the architecture and the extensibility of the SSELab framework. Furthermore, we share our experiences with creating an instance of the framework and integrating various tools for our own software development projects.},

	doi = {10.1080/03075079.2015.1007946},
	abstract = {Digital technologies are now an integral aspect of the university student experience. As such, academic research has understandably focused on the potential of various digital technologies to enable, extend and even 'enhance' student learning. This paper offers an alternate perspective on these issues by exploring students' actual experiences of digital technology during their academic studies – highlighting the aspects of digital technology use that students themselves see as particularly helpful and/or useful. Drawing on a survey of 1658 undergraduate students, the paper identifies 11 distinct digital 'benefits' – ranging from flexibilities of time and place, ease of organizing and managing study tasks through to the ability to replay and revisit teaching materials, and learn in more visual forms. While these data confirm digital technologies as central to the ways in which students experience their studies, they also suggest that digital technologies are not 'transforming' the nature of university teaching and learning. As such, university educators perhaps need to temper enthusiasms for what might be achieved through technology-enabled learning and develop better understandings of the realities of students' encounters with digital technology. Introduction Differences have long persisted between the well-proven potential of technology-enabled learning and the less consistent realities of technology use within university teaching and learning. On the one hand, the potential of digital technologies to enhance student learning has been well established. Benefits include the enhanced diversity of provision and equity of access to higher education, alongside the increased efficiency of delivery and personalization of learning processes. Much enthusiasm has also surrounded the development of digital technologies along increasingly personal-ized, remote, adaptive and data-driven lines. Digital technologies of this nature are clearly integral to the future of university education around the world. The imperative for technologically driven forms of higher education is seen to be exacerbated by the changing backgrounds and dispositions of the people now entering universities as undergraduate students. While the crude essentializing notion of the 'digital native' who was 'born digital' has been rightly criticized, the belief remains among many commentators that incoming cohorts of university students are more},

As CBR systems become more frequently deployed in real-world situations and as large-scale case-bases become more commonly used in practice, the development and maintenance of the case-base becomes critical to CBR practitioners. In reality, adding cases to a case-base and updating cases in a case-base can be troublesome and time-consuming pro-cesses. It has become increasingly important for CBR practitioners to be able to implement an efficient way to develop and maintain the case base. However, techniques for case-base development and main-tenance (such as adding cases and updating cases) have not received enough attention and are often neglected by CBR researchers. This paper discusses Wikis and XML (specifically, the Office Open XML for-mat) and proposes an integrated approach to facilitate case-base development and maintenance in add-ing cases and in updating cases.},

	abstract = {There is an inherent flexibility in typesetting a block of text. Traditionally, line breaks would be manually chosen at strategic points in such a way as to minimize the amount of whitespace in each line. Hyphenation would only be used as a last resort. Knuth and Plass automated this optimization procedure, which has been used in various typesetting sys- tems and DTP applications ever since. However, an optimal solution for the line-breaking problem does not necessarily lead us to an optimal document layout on the whole. The flexibility of choosing line breaks enables us, in many cases, to adjust the height of a paragraph by changing the num- ber of lines, without having to make adjustments to font size, leading, etc. In many cases, the word spacing remains within the usual tolerances and visual quality does not no- ticeably suffer. This paper presents a modification to the Knuth-Plass algorithm to return several results for a given column of text, each corresponding to a different height, and describes steps to quantify the amount of expected flexibility in a given paragraph. We conclude with a discussion on how such “sub-optimal” results can lead to a better overall doc- ument layout, particularly in the context of mobile layouts, where flexibility is of key importance.

Changing requirements are often deemed a 'curse' placed upon software engineers. It has been suggested, however, that the problems associated with change exist only in the attitude of software engineers. This is perhaps understandable considering the training methods and tools available to supposedly 'help' them.The evidence shows that quality of management and experience of personnel involved in development contribute more significantly to the success of a development project than any technical aspect. This unfortunately means that the process is highly susceptible to staff turnover which, if uncontrolled, can lead to pending disaster for the users. This suggests a 'better' system would be developed if 'experience' was maintained at a process level, rather that at an individual level.},

This article reports on a study which sought to enhance engagement by giving students exemplar assignments annotated with feedback before submission of their final assignments. This was done by providing an online facility where students could view exemplars and post comments or questions to tutors and peers on a discussion board. The exemplar facility was highly valued by students, although there were no quantitative effects such as an increase in students’ assignment marks when compared with the previous cohort. The article reflects on possible reasons for this result and discusses ways to improve the exemplar facility, for example by facilitating dialogue between tutors and students. The article concludes with lessons learned about how to construct exemplars, and considers how exemplars might also be used within marking teams to improve consistency of marking.},

We start by populating a seed database with records extracted from a few initial sites. We then identify values within the pages of each new site that match attribute values contained in the seed set of records. To match attribute values with diverse representations across sites, we define a new similarity metric that leverages the templatized structure of attribute content. Specifi-cally, our metric discovers the matching pattern between attribute values from two sites, and uses this to ignore extraneous portions of attribute values when computing similarity scores. Further, to filter out noisy attribute value matches, we exploit the fact that attribute values occur at fixed positions within template-based sites. We de-velop an efficient Apriori-style algorithm to systematically enumer-ate attribute position configurations with sufficient matching values across pages. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental study with real-life web data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our ex-traction approach.},

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {XML is widely recognized as the data interchange standard of tomorrow because of its ability to represent data from a variety of sources. Hence, XML is likely to be the format through which data from multiple sources is integrated. In this article, we study the problem of integrating XML data sources through correlations realized as join operations. A challenging aspect of this operation is the XML document structure. Two documents might convey approximately or exactly the same information but may be quite different in structure. Consequently, an approximate match in struc-ture, in addition to content, has to be folded into the join operation. We quantify an approximate match in structure and content for pairs of XML documents using well defined notions of distance. We show how notions of distance that have metric properties can be incorporated in a framework for joins between XML data sources and introduce the idea of reference sets to facilitate this operation. Intuitively, a reference set consists of data elements used to project the data space. We character-ize what constitutes a good choice of a reference set, and we propose sampling-based algorithms to identify them. We then instantiate our join framework using the tree edit distance between a pair of trees. We next turn our attention to utilizing well known index structures to improve the performance of approximate XML join operations. We present a methodology enabling adaptation of index structures for this problem, and we instantiate it in terms of the R-tree. We demonstrate S. Guha et al. the practical utility of our solutions using large collections of real and synthetic XML data sets, varying parameters of interest, and highlighting the performance benefits of our approach.},

Most recommender systems resort to contextual information to provide single-source document suggestions, disregarding the manifold Personal Information (PI) sources. We believe that PI can provide a richer background of the user's interests, providing personally-relevant and user-centered suggestions. In this paper, we describe an extensible framework that makes use of both contextual and personal information to provide recommendations that are relevant to the user and the task at hand, instead of only the latter. Herein we also present a preliminary evaluation of our framework still mostly based on contextual information. This pilot study presented satisfying results disambiguating contexts, suggesting web and personal documents and dealing with context changes, paving the way to its enrichment with more PI sources.},

However, in many cases, not all XML data are required to be transformed except for a smaller part described by a user’s query (application). In this paper, we present an approach that optimizes the execution time of an XSLT stylesheet for answering a given XPath query by modifying the XSLT stylesheet in such a way that it would (a) capture only the parts in the XML data that are relevant to the query and (b) process only those XSLT instructions that are relevant to the query. We prove the correctness of our optimization approach, analyze its complexity and present experimental results. The experimental results show that our approach performs the best in terms of execution time, especially when many cost-intensive XSLT instructions can be excluded in the XSLT stylesheet.},

State-of-the-art handwritten text recognition systems allow to speed up the transcription task. Currently, this automatic transcription is far from perfect, and human expert revision is required in order to obtain the actual transcription. In this context, crowdsourcing emerged as a powerful tool for massive transcription at a relatively low cost, since the supervision effort of professional transcribers may be dramatically reduced. However, current transcription crowdsourcing platforms are mainly limited to the use of nonmobile devices, since the use of keyboards in mobile devices is not friendly enough for most users. This work presents the alternative of using speech dictation of handwritten text lines as transcription source in a crowdsourcing platform. The experiments explore how an initial handwritten text recognition hypothesis can be improved by using the contribution of speech recognition from several speakers, providing as a final result a better hypothesis to be amended by a professional transcriber with less effort.},

Previous studies have explored library metaphors, using either textual analysis or ethnographic methods to investigate their usage. However, this is to our knowledge the first study to use bibliographic data, corpus analysis, qualitative sentiment weighting and close reading to study particular metaphors in detail. It draws on a corpus of over 450 articles to study the use of the metaphors of the Library of Alexandria and Babel, concluding that both have been extremely useful as framing metaphors for the digital library. However, their longstanding use has seen them become stretched as metaphors, meaning that the field’s figurative framework now fails to represent the changing technologies which underpin contemporary digital libraries.},

Computer games are an important part of modern popular culture, and yet are afforded little of the respect bestowed upon established media such as books, film, television and music. We must understand the reasons for the current lack of computer game preservation in order to devise strategies for the future. Computer game history is a difficult area to work in, because it is impossible to know what has been lost already, and early records are often incomplete. This paper uses the information that is available to analyse the current status of computer game preservation, specifically in the UK. It makes a quantitative analysis of the preservation status of computer games, and finds that games are already in a vulnerable state. It proposes that work should be done to compile accurate metadata on computer games and to analyse more closely the exact scale of data loss, while suggesting strategies to overcome the barriers that currently exist.},

However, we believe it will continue to be extended and it is important to understand how iStar is extended. This paper contributes to this purpose through the identification and analysis of the existing extensions and its constructs. A Systematic Literature Review was conducted to guide identification and analysis. The results point to 96 papers and 307 constructs proposed. The extensions and constructs were analysed according to well-defined questions in three di-mensions: a general analysis; model-based analysis (to characterise the extensions from semantic and syntactic definitions); and a third dimension related to semiotic clarity. The application area targeted by the iStar extensions and their evolutions are presented as results of our analysis. The results point to the need for more complete, consistent and careful development of iStar extensions. The paper concludes with some discussions and future directions for this research field.},

Instead of performing a pairwise comparison between posts, the model matches the values of the web feeds against their corresponding HTML elements retrieved from multiple weblog posts.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose and test a framework for assessing the level of localisation on web sites. Design/methodology/approach – This paper identifies the key forms of localisation that may be evident on a web site. A two-by-two matrix is presented which incorporates language in one dimension and non-language criteria in the other. Web sites are then evaluated against these criteria and mapped onto the matrix to assess the relative level of localisation between web sites. The criteria and matrix have been tested against web sites operating in the Greek exporting sector. Findings – The framework was found to be easy to use in practice. While a large set of potential localisation criteria were identified, only a subgroup of these criteria are likely to be relevant for any target group of web sites and the framework should therefore be scoped to match the characteristics of the survey group. The issue of localisation was not found to have been addressed to any great extent amongst the sample of Greek exporting companies. Research limitations/implications – The sample used was small as the prime purpose was to test the usability of the framework, and further evaluations will be needed to confirm these initial findings. Practical implications – Given the relative poor performance of the Greek exporting sector, localisation is an aspect that should be given higher priority. The framework represents a cost-effective method for self-assessment and benchmarking against competitors. Originality/value – The framework is novel and should be usable by both web designers and users.},

	abstract = {" There will always (I hope) be print books, but just as the advent of photography changed the role of painting or film changed the role of theater in our culture, electronic publishing is changing the world of print media. To look for a one-to-one transposition to the new medium is to miss the future until it has passed you by. " —Tim O'Reilly (2002). It is not hard to envisage that publishers will leverage subscribers' information, interest groups' shared knowledge and others sources to enhance their publications. While this enhances the value of the publication through more accurate and personalized content, it also brings a new set of challenges to the publisher. Content is now driven by web and in a truly automated system, that is, no designer " re-touch " intervention is envisaged. This paper introduces an exploratory mapping strategy to allocate web driven content in a highly graphical publication like a traditional magazine. Two major aspects of the mapping are covered, those enable different level of flexibility and address different content flowing strategies. The last contribution is an evaluation of existing standards, which potentially can leverage this work to incorporate flexible mapping, and subsequently, composition capabilities. The work published here is an extended version of the article presented at the Eight ACM Symposium on Document Engineering in fall 2008 (Giannetti 2008).},

	abstract = {Cloud service description (CSD) becomes an active area which attracts the attention of many research organizations, while no standard CSD exists. This lack of standardization is caused by the vendor lock-in problem, where cloud providers use various techniques (languages, standards, ontologies, models, etc.) to describe cloud services. Furthermore, there are few studies which dealt with the four aspects of service especially the technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. Whereas, many other studies dealt only with some of these four aspects. This is the case of WSDL (Web Service Description Language) language, which focuses in the technical aspect, but it does not cover business and semantic ones. Our objective in this paper is to identify the foundations of a standardized CSD covering the technical, operational, business, and semantic aspects. We present a comparative study of the different approaches that address CSD issues. The result of this comparative study shows that USDL (Unified Service Description Language) is the appropriate language supporting a service description by covering three aspects (technical, operational, and business), despite its inability to cover the semantic aspect.},

Designing processes often leads to duplication which makes the workflow descriptor complicated and unnecessarily large. Furthermore, due to the static character of the scripts, there is insufficient flexibility to model dynamic, evolvable and failsafe workflows. In this paper we present a framework that allows the design of WS-BPEL processes in a modular way based on reusable templates. In addition, we introduce an extra layer on top of WS-BPEL that allows template processing based on parameter values. This layer offers support for decision logic to adapt processes dynamically. The approach is based on the "Ruby On Rails" (RoR) framework, known for adding dynamism to static web pages. The proposed solution is portable with existing WS-BPEL engines.},

In this paper we provide an introduction to the emerging field of software architecture. We begin by considering a number of common architectural styles upon which many systems are currently based and show how different styles can be combined in a single design. Then we present six case studies to illustrate how architectural representations can improve our understanding of complex software systems. Finally, we survey some of the outstanding problems in the field, and consider a few of the promising research directions.},

The application of gamification in Software Engineering can be promising; software projects can be organized as a set of challenges which can be ordered and that need to be fulfilled, for which some skills, and mainly much collective effort, are required. The objective of this paper is to pro-pose a complete framework for the introduction of gamification in software engineering environments. This framework is composed of an ontology, a methodology guiding the process, and a support gami-fication engine. We carried out a case study in which the proposed framework was applied in a real company. In this project the company used the framework to gamify the areas of project management, requirements management, and testing. As a result, the methodology has clearly enabled the company to introduce gamification in its work environment, achieving a quality solution with appropriate design and development effort. The support tool allowed the company to gamify its current tools very easily.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10506-007-9032-6},
	abstract = {In order to improve the management of copyright in the Internet, known as Digital Rights Management, there is the need for a shared language for copyright representation. Current approaches are based on purely syntactic solutions, i.e. a grammar that defines a rights expression language. These languages are difficult to put into practise due to the lack of explicit semantics that facilitate its implementation. Moreover, they are simple from the legal point of view because they are intended just to model the usage licenses granted by content providers to end-users. Thus, they ignore the copyright framework that lies behind and the whole value chain from creators to end-users. Our proposal is to use a semantic approach based on semantic web ontologies. We detail the development of a copyright ontology in order to put this approach into practice. It models the copyright core concepts for creation, rights and the basic kinds of actions that operate on content. Altogether, it allows building a copyright framework for the complete value chain. The set of actions operating on content are our smaller building blocks in order to cope with the complexity of copyright value chains and statements and, at the same time, guarantee a high level of inter-operability and evolvability. The resulting copyright modelling framework is flexible and complete enough to model many copyright scenarios, not just those related to the economic exploitation of content. The ontology also includes moral rights, so it is possible to model this kind of situations as it is shown in the included example model for a withdrawal scenario. Finally, the ontology design and the selection of tools result in a straightforward implementation. Description Logic reasoners are used for license checking and retrieval. Rights are modelled as classes of actions, action patterns are modelled also as classes and the same is done for concrete actions. Then, to check if some right or license grants an action is reduced to check for class subsumption, which is a direct functionality of these reasoners.},

(ii) Forward reasoning and backward planning ability. We propose that forward reasoning can be implemented based on the Rete algorithm and backward planning can be implemented based on a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN), which enable W2T to achieve complex, rapid, and efficient reasoning and planning to provide active, transparent, safe, and reliable services. (iii) A knowledge base evolution mechanism based on a learning classifier system, which is to realize the evolution of the knowledge base, and to satisfy the dynamic requirements of wisdom services.

This paper intends to map the state of the art on the use and understanding of gamification in industrial software development. We aim to review the definitions of gamification adopted in software engineering studies, identify the elements of games that are used to motivate software engineers, and map the specific areas of software engineering that have been addressed so far. For that end, we conducted a mixed method literature review, covering 130 studies. From such review, we found that (1) researchers in the field tend towards a strict view of gamification, (2) the practical results of gamification are unclear and polemic, and (3) this research area has still much to improve.},

New XML data will be stored, searched, and manipulated in the database as a "first class" citizen along with existing relational data. Furthermore, new applications will emerge that solely operate in terms of XML. These new XML applications operate on the same database using an XML query language, XQuery. In this paper, we describe an integrated database architecture that enables SQL applications with XML extensions as well as XQuery applications to operate on the same data.

The approach consists of analysing an XSLT using a structure descriptor such as DTD or XSD to determine the different types of XML documents that can be generated. The strength of the presented approach is given by the fact that the use of XML features enhances the results gathered from automatic accesibility evaluation of dynamic Web pages.},

We address both questions by present- ing the design of our summer camp, an overview of our curriculum, our assessment methodology, and our assessment results. Though the sample size is not statistically significant, the re- sults show that a two-week, interdisciplinary, non-academic sum- mer camp can be effective not only for engaging students, but also for imparting CS content. In just two weeks, with a curriculum not entirely focused on computer science, students displayed compe- tence with event-driven programming, initialization of state, mes- sage passing, and say/sound synchronization1.

	abstract = {Abstract: Conventional taught learning practices often experience difficulties in keeping students motivated and engaged. Video games, however, are very successful at sustaining high levels of motivation and engagement through a set of tasks for hours without apparent loss of focus. In addition, gamers solve complex problems within a gaming environment without feeling fatigue or frustration, as they would typically do with a comparable learning task. Based on this notion, the academic community is keen on exploring methods that can deliver deep learner engagement and has shown increased interest in adopting gamification â€“ the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into non-game situations and scenarios â€“ as a means to increase student engagement and improve information retention. Its effectiveness when applied to education has been debatable though, as attempts have generally been restricted to one-dimensional approaches such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching materials and/or assessments. Nevertheless, a gamified, multi-dimensional, problem-based learning approach can yield improved results even when applied to a very complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming, as shown in this paper. The presented quasi-experimental study used a combination of instructor feedback, real time sequence of scored quizzes, and live coding to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. More specifically, the â€œKahoot!â€• Classroom Response System (CRS), the classroom version of the TV game show â€œWho Wants To Be A Millionaire?â€•, and Codecademyâ€™s interactive platform formed the basis for a learning model which was applied to an entry-level Python programming course. Students were thus allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to those commonly found in a top quality game experience. To assess gamificationâ€™s impact on learning, empirical data from the gamified group were compared to those from a control group who was taught through a traditional learning app},

Twenty-two postgraduates were randomly split into two groups taught by the same instructor. The experimental group attended a course that incorporated the notion of meaningful gamification – that is, utilising the game mechanics of points, badges, and a leader board, as well as activities based on self-determination theory. The control group attended the same course and activities taught by the same instructor but without the game mechanics. Data sources included students' pre-and post-tests scores, group artefact scores, discussion forum posts, students' questionnaire survey, students' interviews, and the teacher's self-reflections. Results suggest that students in the experimental group posted more messages in the discussion forums than the control group. Furthermore, the quality of group artefacts produced by the participants in the experimental group was overall higher than those in the control group. All students in the experimental group strongly agreed or agreed that they found the course motivating. However, only about half the participants in the control group found the course motivating.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t In the software development (e.g. with product lines or refactoring) transformations play an increasing role. To ease and automate these transformations, we propose a solution based on the operator hierarchy concept. It allows to define transformation operator hierarchies containing different levels of transforma-tion operators. The operators capture reusable knowledge units. The concrete realization of such a higher-level transformation language construction is demonstrated by an application of the XML opera-tor hierarchy concept to the transformation language XSLT. XSLT serves as an example which is employed to provide the elementary transformation operators. On top of these elementary operators the layered concept allows the definition of new higher-level operators, e.g. domain-independent and domain-spe-cific ones. In an application example the construction of the higher-level language XML2DSV is presented. This is a stand-alone domain-specific transformation language, which can be used to create delimiter-separated values (DSV) files from XML documents, on the base of XSLT. We developed XTC (XML Trans-formation Coordinator) to automate the multi-level transformation process.},

This approach enables new applications that can be deployed smoothly on the web.

A language that addresses these issues is presented in this paper. Its role is to specify semantically rich XML languages in terms of other XML lan-guages, such as XHTML. The language is versatile enough to represent templates that can capture the overall structure of large documents as well as the fine details of a microformat.

	abstract = {The use of declarative languages in digital TV systems, as well as IPTV systems, facilitates the creation of interactive applications. However, when an ap-plication becomes more complex, with many user interactions, for example, the hypermedia document that describes that application becomes bigger, having many lines of XML code. Thus, specification reuse is crucial for an efficient application development process. This paper proposes the XTemplate 3.0 language, which allows the creation of NCL hypermedia composite templates. Templates define generic structures of nodes and links to be added to a document composition, providing spatio-temporal synchronization semantics to it. The use of hypermedia composite templates aims at facilitating the authoring work, allowing the reuse of hypermedia document common specifications. Using composite templates, hyper-media documents become simpler and easier to be created. The 3.0 version of XTemplate adds new facilities to the XTemplate language, such as the possibility of specifying presentation information, the attribution of values to variables and connector parameters during template processing time and the template ability to extend other templates. As an application of XTemplate, this work extends the NCL 3.0 declarative language with XTemplate, adding semantics to NCL contexts and providing document structure reuse. In addition, this paper also presents two authoring tools: the template processor and the wizard to create NCL documents using templates. The wizard tool allows the author to choose a template included This work was partially supported by CNPq, FAPERJ and CAPES.

	abstract = {XML is the " lingua franca " for data exchange between interenterprise applications. In this work, we describe SilkRoute, a framework for publishing relational data in XML. In SilkRoute, relational data is published in three steps: the relational tables are presented to the database administrator in a canonical XML view; the database administrator defines in the XQuery query language a public, virtual XML view over the canonical XML view; and an application formulates an XQuery query over the public view. SilkRoute composes the application query with the public-view query, trans-lates the result into SQL, executes this on the relational engine, and assembles the resulting tuple streams into an XML document. This work makes some key contributions to XML query processing. First, it describes an algorithm that translates an XQuery expression into SQL. The translation depends on a query representation that separates the structure of the output XML document from the computation that produces the document's content. The second contribution addresses the opti-mization problem of how to decompose an XML view over a relational database into an optimal set of SQL queries. We define formally the optimization problem, describe the search space, and propose a greedy, cost-based optimization algorithm, which obtains its cost estimates from the relational engine. Experiments confirm that the algorithm produces queries that are nearly optimal.},

Results show that students who were given the relevant criteria made more accurate assessments of an expert model, performed better on a test and achieved higher instructional efficiency (defined as the relationship between performance and mental effort) compared to students who were given all criteria. Students who were given performance-based assessment criteria made more accurate assessments of an expert model and scored higher on task performance during practice compared to students who were given competency-based assessment criteria. They invested less mental effort in the assessments, resulting in higher instructional efficiency. An interaction effect for the concreteness of answers shows that the combination of performance-based and relevant criteria leads to superior analysis of worked examples compared to the other combinations of criteria.},

These languages generally describe the behaviors of a middleware controller that builds an output tree iteratively, issuing queries to a relational source and expanding the tree with the query results at each step. To study the complexity and expres-sive power of XML publishing languages, this article proposes a notion of publishing transducers, which generate XML trees from relational data. We study a variety of publishing transducers based on what relational queries a transducer can issue, what temporary stores a transducer can use during tree generation, and whether or not some tree nodes are allowed to be virtual, that is, excluded from the output tree. We first show how existing XML publishing languages can be characterized by such transducers, and thus provide a synergy between theory and practice. We then study the membership, emptiness, and equivalence problems for various classes of trans-ducers. We establish lower and upper bounds, all matching, ranging from PTIME to undecidable. Finally, we investigate the expressive power of these transducers and existing languages. We show that when treated as relational query languages, different classes of transducers capture either complexity classes (e.g., PSPACE) or fragments of datalog (e.g., linear datalog). For tree generation, we establish connections between publishing transducers and logical transductions, among other things.},

	abstract = {Gamification is becoming a widely used technique in an attempt to improve engagement and effectiveness of learning, with virtual rewards (often in the form of badges) frequently forming a core part of this structure. But how do badges actually work? Recent studies in gamification have clearly identified that while we can say this approach works, any analysis of the success stories quickly confirms that context is essential in both the system we gamify and the users that take part. In the absence of context, a badge is obviously meaning and valueless, but studies in badge use generally refer to success without focusing on the underlying process and, in some cases, report significance without effect size, report the badge without the process or do not sufficiently isolate the variables to allow us to address what the influence of the badge is. In this paper, we classify the existing work to identify the existing research where badges have been evaluated in a way that appears significant, with properly established control groups, isolation of factors and longitudinal considerations, and with an exposure of the underlying process to determine if what we are seeing is a successful process in action that has a badge at the end, rather than a process that has been made successful through badge use. A badge system can be a proxy for scaffolding and an individual badge can give focus much in the way we would expect in cognitive apprenticeship but both of these outcomes have strong implications that there is a definite limit to how many badges we award, the way in which they are contextualised and the training framework in which they are presented.

This paper introduces an approach on extending the concept of galley to a generalized document design instrument. The proposed solution has the aim of providing an easy and flexible, yet powerful, way to express complex layout for highly dynamic and re-flowing content. To achieve this goal, not only it is important to express all the areas available within the page or page region, but also identify a mean to efficiently map content to them. To serve this purpose, a role based mapper has been introduced linking both flow and out-of-flow content.},

We (1) compare properties of non-reproducible reports with their counterparts such as active time and number of authors, (2) investigate their life-cycle patterns, and (3) examine 120 Fixed non-reproducible reports. In addition, we qualitatively classify a set of randomly selected non-reproducible bug reports (1,643) into six common categories. Our results show that, on average, non-reproducible bug reports pertain to 17\% of all bug reports, remain active three months longer than their counterparts, can be mainly (45\%) classified as 'Interbug Dependencies'', and 66\% of Fixed non-reproducible reports were indeed reproduced and fixed.},

The key notion of enriched video and associated concepts is first introduced and we second expose the models we have developed for annotating videos and for presenting annotations during the playing of the videos. Finally, an overview of a general workflow for producing/viewing enriched videos is presented. This workflow particularly illustrates the usage of the proposed models in order to improve the accessibility of videos for sensory disabled people.},

Moving to a reflection in action strategy can help students become more success-ful. Traditional programming assignments are usually assessed in a way that ignores the skills needed for reflection in action, but soft-ware testing promotes the hypothesis-forming and experimental validation that are central to this mode of learning. By changing the way assignments are assessed—where students are responsible for demonstrating correctness through testing, and then assessed on how well they achieve this goal—it is possible to reinforce desired skills.

To share the WBCR effec-tively is a challenging problem in boundary-spanning grid environments, particularly when these resources are sub-ject to both static and dynamic usage. To set up the certif-icate-based usage policy described in this paper, we first explore a workflow engine-driven SOA-based resource access control mechanism. Then, aiming at setting up a cooperative computing paradigm from the resource sharing perspective, an infrastructure derived from a specific project of SOA\&EDSCCE (SOA-Based\&Engine-Driven Structured Cooperative Computing Environment) is proposed for pro-moting its cooperative computing in grid environment based on the control disciplines and the WBCR usage policy. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: 1) a workflow engine-driven SOA-based WBCR sharing mechanism is presented in accordance with to the certificate-based usage policy; and 2) a specific infrastructure of cooperative com-puting is put forward for the collaboration based on the WBCR sharing mechanism.},

Although very useful, multimedia validation tools are not often provided. Spatial validation of multimedia documents may be per-formed over the initial position of media items before pre-sentation starts. However, such an approach does not lead to ideal results when media item placement changes over time. Some document authoring languages allow the defini-tion of spatio-temporal relationships among media items and they can be moved or resized during runtime. Current val-idation approaches do not verify dynamic spatio-temporal relationships. This paper presents a novel approach for spatio-temporal validation of multimedia documents. We model the document state, extending the Simple Hyperme-dia Model (SHM), comprising media item positioning during the whole document presentation. Mapping between docu-ment states represent time lapse or user interaction. We also define a set of atomic formulas upon which the author's expectations related to the spatio-temporal layout can be described and analyzed.},

	abstract = {Background: Technology transfer is one key to the success of research projects, especially in Software Engineering, where the (practical) impact of the outcome may depend not only on the reliability and feasibility of technologies, but also on their applicability to industrial settings. However, there is limited knowledge on the current state of practice and how to assess the success of technology transfer. Objective: We aim at elaborating a set of hypotheses on how technology transfer takes place in Software Engineering research projects. Method: We designed an exploratory survey with the participants of two large research projects in Germany, which involve both industrial and academic partners in the area of model driven development for embedded systems. Results: Base on the extracted respondents answers of this survey, we defined a resulting theory which is based on the following set of main hypothesis: Most of the technologies developed in research projects are not mature enough for a direct application, but need post-project customisation to fit the industrial contexts (H1). Common models that represent technology transfer as a transaction of an object from a transferor to a transferee does not fit industrial reality (H2). Additionally, technology transfer takes place without an explicit process (H3). Regarding transfer mediums, most used mediums are human-intensive (H5) and industry organisations gain new knowledge mainly within their own confines (H4). Finally the motivations that drive the transfer in industry and academia are heterogenous (H6). Conclusions: From the theoretical perspective, this theory and set of hypotheses extracted from the survey results will be further explored and tested in different follow-up activities. This initial set, however, already may serve as a basis for independent assessments from other researchers to collaboratively shed light on a how technology transfer takes place in Software Engineering research projects, which are the barriers, and how to improve the transfer into practice. From the practical perspective, our results may be used as a basis for an evaluation framework for the transfer of the developed technologies in our projects. This would also help companies in getting new developed technologies transfer easier to their specific context. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Gamification of education is a developing approach for increasing learners' motivation and engagement by incorporating game design elements in educational environments. With the growing popularity of gamification and yet mixed success of its application in educational contexts, the current review is aiming to shed a more realistic light on the research in this field by focusing on empirical evidence rather than on potentialities, beliefs or preferences. Accordingly, it critically examines the advancement in gamifying education. The discussion is structured around the used gamification mechanisms, the gamified subjects, the type of gamified learning activities, and the study goals, with an emphasis on the reliability and validity of the reported outcomes. To improve our understanding and offer a more realistic picture of the progress of gamification in education, consistent with the presented evidence, we examine both the outcomes reported in the papers and how they have been obtained. While the gamification in education is still a growing phenomenon, the review reveals that (i) insufficient evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of gamification in educational contexts; (ii) the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers' understanding of its mechanisms and methods; (iii) the knowledge of how to gamify an activity in accordance with the specifics of the educational context is still limited. The review highlights the need for systematically designed studies and rigorously tested approaches confirming the educational benefits of gamification, if gamified learning is to become a recognized instructional approach.},

The different constraints, including poor usability, lack of positioning support, costs, and integration difficulties are highlighted. A framework was designed incorporating components based on existing and new technologies that could help address the constraints of LBS and increase end-user acceptance. This research proposes that usability constraints can be addressed by adapting a system to user characteristics which are inferred on the basis of captured user context and interaction data. A prototype LBS system was developed to prove the feasibility and benefit of the framework design, demonstrating that constraints of positioning, cost, and integration can be overcome. Volunteers were asked to use the system, and to answer questions in relation to their proficiency and experience. User-feedback showed that the proposed combination of functionality was well-received, and the prototype was appealing to many users. Ground-truths from the survey were related back to data captured with a user monitoring component in order to investigate whether users can be classified according to their context and how they interact. The results have shown that statistically significant relationships exist, and that by using the C4.5 decision-tree, computer proficiency can be estimated within one class-width in 76.7\% of the cases. These results suggest that it may be possible to build a user-model to estimate computer proficiency on the basis of user-interaction data. The user model could then used to improve usability through adaptive user-specific customisations.},

Each framework has its own best practices facilitating the development of web applications, and giving benefits such as saving money, improving the development effort, and reducing the development time. Lift emerges as a new Web framework which has it is own features and learns from the mistakes of other Web frameworks. Some companies such as Siemens and IBM are developing theirs applications in Scala and Lift, as well as social networks like Twitter and Foursquare. However Lift is a new Web framework and for hence it has a lack of documentation for developing Web applications through of best practices. The contribution of this paper is to obtain and discusses the best practices in order to develop Web applications with Lift avoiding common mistakes of design and implementation that other Web frameworks have. With these best practices, the developers can develop more interactive and efficient Web applications integrating features of Web 2.0 technologies with less effort as well as exploiting the framework benefits. Authors consider this work provides a guide for the Web applications development, which impacts in the software engineering community decreasing the number of errors in the implementation phase.

The effects of a gamification plugin deployed in a learning management system were compared to those of a social networking site in the same educational setting. We found that both approaches presented better performance than a traditional e-learning approach in terms of academic achievement for practical assignments, but that, when it came to assessing knowledge, the traditional e-learning approach was better.

	abstract = {Modern WWW methodologies focus on developing context-aware data delivery applications on the Web, but very few proposals provide a conceptual modeling of their adaptation specifications. In this paper, we present AML-Adaptation Modeling Language-to specify complex Adaptive Web Applications at the conceptual level. AML models the adaptation process by using a special workflow involving modeling primitives that execute elementary manipulations. The adaptation considers different and orthogonal components of the context and operates over the selection of the most suitable contents, the organization of the hypertext structure of the response, and the layout of the final pages. The language and its design process are fully implemented in a CASE tool, called FAWIS. Specifically, FAWIS is able to access a Web data source and automatically filter and adapt information delivery on the basis of the context of the client. The tool is able to manage heterogeneous contexts, is easy extensible to new coordinates of adaptation, and can integrate different adaptation requirements solving possible conflicts between them. It allows the designer to define the response that better satisfies the requirements of adaptation for a context. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.},

	abstract = {Gamification is a term that refers to the use of game elements in non-game contexts with the goal of engaging people in a variety of tasks. There is a growing interest in gamification as well as its applications and implications in the field of Education since it provides an alternative to engage and motivate students during the process of learning. Despite this increasing interest, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that cover and classify the types of research being published and the most investigated topics in the area. As a first step towards bridging this gap, we carried out a systematic mapping to synthesize an overview of the area. We went through 357 papers on gamification. Among them, 48 were related to education and only 26 met the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles defined in this study. These 26 papers were selected and categorized according to their contribution. As a result, we provide an overview of the area. Such an overview suggests that most studies focus on investigating how gamification can be used to motivate students, improve their skills, and maximize learning.},

The idea of developing a traditional library has been discarded in order to free portal developers from a particular implementation technology.

	volume = {95},
	doi = {10.1016/j.infsof.2017.09.014},
	abstract = {Context: The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, recent technologies have provided new opportunities for using games and their elements to enhance learning and student engagement. Objective: The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we discuss how game-related methods have been used in the context of software engineering education by means of a systematic mapping study. Second, we investigate how these game-related methods support specific knowledge areas from software engineering. By achieving these goals, we aim not only to characterize the state of the art on the use of game-related methods on software engineering education, but also to identify gaps and opportunities for further research. Method: We carried out a systematic mapping study to identify primary studies which address the use, proposal or evaluation of games and their elements on software engineering education. We classified primary studies based on type of approaches, learning goals based on software engineering knowledge areas, and specific characteristics of each type of approach. Results: We identified 156 primary studies, published between 1974 and June 2016. Most primary studies de-scribe the use of serious games (86) and game development (57) for software engineering education, while Gamification is the least explored method (10). Learning goals of these studies and their development of skills are mostly related to the knowledge areas of " Software Process " , " Software Design " , and " Professional Practices " . Conclusions: The use of games in software engineering education is not new. However, there are some knowl-edge areas where the use of games can still be further explored. Gamification is a new trend and existing research in the field is quite preliminary. We also noted a lack of standardization both in the definition of learning goals and in the classification of game-related methods.},

	abstract = {Gamification is the use of video-game mechanics and elements in nongame contexts to enhance user engagement and performance. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review to have an in-depth investigation into the existing gamification solutions targeted at solving user engagement problems in different categories of software. We carried out this systematic review by proposing a framework of gamifying process, which is the basis for comparison of existing gamification solutions. In order to report the review, the primary studies are categorized according to the following: a) gamified software and their platforms; b) elements of the gamifying process; c) gamification solutions in each software type; d) gamification solutions for software user engagement problems; e) gamification solutions in general; and f) effects of gamification on software user engagement and performance. Based on the search procedure and criteria, a total of 78 primary studies were extracted. Most of the studies focused on educational and social software, which were developed for web or mobile platforms. We concluded that the number of studies on motivating users to use software content, solving problems in learning software, and using real identity is very limited. Furthermore, few studies have been carried out on gamifying the following software categories: productivity software, cloud storage, utility software, entertainment software, search engine software, tool software, fitness software, software engineering, information worker software, and health-care software. In addition, a large number of gamification solutions are relatively simple and require improvement. Thus, for future studies, researchers can work on the items discovered in this review; they can improve the quality of the current gamified systems by using a wide variety of game mechanics and interface elements, utilizing a combination of contextual types of rewards and giving users the ability to use received rewards “in-game” and “out-game.”},

Four hundred and ninety one students participated in the second study, which compared scores on a standardized test of basic science knowledge among groups experiencing various levels of lecture-capture implementation. Students were most likely to view captured lectures in courses that moved quickly, relied heavily on lecture, were perceived as highly relevant to their future success, and contained information not available in other formats. A greater percentage of students than faculty perceived lecture capture as beneficial to learning. Higher views of captured lectures were associated with higher test scores in disciplines that relied most heavily on a straight-lecture teaching approach and had a basic science – research teaching context. The number of lecture-capture views was not significantly related to test scores in disciplines that relied less heavily on straight lecture for instruction and had a basic science – applied teaching context.},

Game industry discourse is concerned with continuous redesign of gameplay to enhance players' ex-perience and boost game's appeal. However, accounts of gameplay requirements practices are rare. In responding to calls for more research into gameplay requirements engineering, we performed an ex-ploratory study in the context of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), from the perspective of practitioners involved in the field. Sixteen practitioners from three leading MMORPG-producing companies were interviewed and their gameplay requirements documents were reviewed. In-terviewing and qualitative data analysis occurred in a cyclical process with results at each stage of the study informing decisions about data collection and analysis in the next. The analysis revealed a process of striving to reach a balance among three perspectives of gameplay requirements: a process perspective, an artifact perspective and a player-designer relationship perspec-tive. This balance-driven process is co-created by game developers and players, is endless within the MMORPG, and is happening both in-game and off-game. It heavily relies on 'paper-prototyping' and play-testing for the purpose of gameplay requirements validation. The study concludes with discussion on validity threats and on implications for requirements engineering research, practice and education.},

The model formally incorporates key design variables such as content pagination, relative arrangement possibilities for page elements and possible page edits. These design choices are modeled jointly as coupled random variables (a Bayesian Network) with uncertainty modeled by their probability distributions. The overall joint probability distribution for the network assigns higher probability to good design choices. Given this model, we show that the general document layout problem can be reduced to probabilistic inference over the Bayesian network. We show that the inference task may be accomplished efficiently, scaling linearly with the content in the best case. We provide a useful specialization of the general model and use it to illustrate the advantages of soft probabilistic encodings over hard one-way constraints in specifying design aesthetics.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.135},
	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Recently there has been much interest in electronic commerce applications that use data mining tech-niques to explore datasets in the social media context. However, most of the applications have already been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications. This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms. In order to improve the efficacy of infor-mation extraction from blogs, ontology is used in the blog's description. For this, there are software agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse. This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining) providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework, which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user's sentiment regarding specific products is reported and its results con-siders the effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed application, such as the evolution impact.},

	abstract = {To put a finer point on the influence of the ENIAC on IBM, engineers from the Endicott, New York, plant, specializing in input/output card equipment, visited the ENIAC while it was under construction and observed the use of a card reader with it. But as a general statement, what the ENIAC did to the office appliance and electrical supply firms during World War II was to call out the possibility that a new class of hardware was emerging. In the years following - that is to say, from 1946 to roughly 1951/1952 - the system confirmed that development. Electrical engineers at IBM, NCR, Burroughs, and GE took notice; although as time passed, they focused greater attention on computers that followed ENIAC, as there were nearly two dozen such projects underway in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Historians have carefully documented the work of Eckert and Mauchly in the 1940s, recording that the experiences they gained in building the ENIAC directly and explicitly influenced their work on several subsequent systems: the EDVAC, BINAC, and Univac. Explicitly, the ENIAC taught Eckert and Mauchly their initial lessons about building computers, providing insights that carried over to future projects.},

	abstract = {Organizations today rely on survey research to gather much-needed business intelligence. For example, surveys can help you understand customer preferences about a particular product, gauge employee satisfaction or identify market opportunities. But survey research is much more than simply asking someone a few questions. It’s a multi-step process with a clearly defined protocol for each step. To get reliable results from your survey research, you must be able to plan the survey research project, collect data, access and manage the data easily, as well as report the results. IBM® SPSS® predictive analytics software can help ensure your research project is a success, allowing you to confidently share your results with the decision makers who can act upon them. Effective surveys need to be: • Clearly defined—before beginning, you need to state the goals and objectives • Easily completed—the respondents must be able to easily understand and answer your questions • Smoothly processed—before you can begin analysis, the data must be cleaned and validated • Thoroughly analyzed—so you can get useful, reliable results • Timely—the time between planning and deployment must be short enough to make a difference to your organization This white paper discusses survey research as a seven-step process, detailing how to maximize your efforts every step of the way. At each stage, it also shows how IBM SPSS predictive analytics technology can improve your results and make the entire survey research process easier and more effective. While the examples provided are commercially oriented ,they also apply to the public sector.},

	abstract = {Abstract Purpose – Qualitative research has made important contributions to social science by enabling researchers to engage with people and get an in-depth understanding of their views, beliefs and perceptions about social phenomena. With new and electronically mediated forms of human interaction (e.g. the online world), there are new opportunities for researchers to gather data and participate with or observe people in online groups. The purpose of this paper is to present features, challenges and possibilities for online ethnography as an innovative form of qualitative research. Design/methodology/approach – Ethnography is about telling a story about what happens in a particular setting or settings. In order to do this online, it is important to revisit, adopt and adapt some ideas about traditional (offline) ethnography. The paper distinguishes online ethnography from other types of research. It draws some generic features of online ethnography and identifies challenges for it. With these ideas in mind the paper presents and provides a reflection of an online ethnography of software developers. Findings – Online ethnography can provide valuable insights about social phenomena. The paper identifies generic features of this approach and a number of challenges related to its practice. These challenges have to dowith to the choice of settings, use of online data for research, representation of people and generation of valuable and useful knowledge. The paper also highlights issues for future consideration in research and practice. Practical implications – The ethnography helped the researcher to identify and address a number of methodological challenges in practice and position herself in relation to relevant audiences she wanted to speak to. The paper also suggests different orientations to online ethnography. Lessons learned highlight potential contributions as well as further possibilities for qualitative research in the online world. Originality/value – Online ethnography offers possibilities to engage with a global audience of research subjects. For academics and practitioners the paper opens up possibilities to use online tools for research and it shows that the use of these tools can help overcome difficulties in access and interaction with people and to study a diversity of research topics, not only those that exist online. The paper offers guidance for researchers about where to start and how to proceed if they want to conduct online ethnography and generate useful and valuable knowledge in their area of interest.

Fully compatible with both traditional object-oriented software engineering methods and newer agile techniques such as Extreme Programming, this approach employs rapid, card-based techniques to develop simplified models of user roles, tasks, and user interface contents. The process attempts to resolve the conflict between the demands of rapid iterative design and incremental development on the one hand and the needs for integrity in a user interface fitted to the full set of user tasks on the other. The resolution depends on creating a navigation architecture and a visual and interaction design scheme based on quick but comprehensive task modeling. The process is illustrated with experiences from the design of a Web-deployed application for classroom teachers.},

From the outset, the Department's CS1 course has presented significant teaching challenges due to the wide diversity of student's taking the class. Traditionally, only 25-35°/. of the students enrolled in the course are computing science majors, the remaining being students from a wide diversity of disciplines, many of which are non-science based. Despite the diversity, it has been necessary for the course, and its content, to be structured to satisfy essential core requirements for students majonng in computer science and computer information science as well as to meet program requirements for the many non-computer science majors taking the course. This paper discusses some of the unique issues associated with teaching a Java-based CS 1 course to a very diverse group of students, the majority of which have very unsophisticated problem solving skills, and little or no programming expertise.

Studies have shown that visitors can draw on their museum experience, long after their visit, to learn new things in practical situations. Rather than viewing a visit as a single learning event, we are interested in ways of extending the experience to allow visitors to access online resources tailored to their interests. Museums typically have extensive archives that can be made available online, the challenge is to match these resources to the visitor's interests and present them in a manner that facilitates exploration and engages the visitor. We propose the use of knowledge level resource descriptions to identify relevant resources and create structured presentations. A system that embodies this approach, which is in use in a UK museum, is presented and the applicability of the approach to the broader semantic web is discussed.},

	doi = {10.4102/sajip.v38i2.993},
	abstract = {Orientation: Organisational silos do not only refer to conscious structures, but also to an unconscious state of mind and mentality that takes on a life of its own. Silos result in the splitting of organisational artefacts and relationships, and impact negatively on relationship forming between individuals and within teams. Research purpose: The purpose of this research was to describe how the silo mentality impacts on team identity. Motivation for the study: During a recent organisational consultation the researchers realised that a so-called silo phenomenon had much more unexplained unconscious behaviour than was traditionally realised in terms of organisational development. It is hoped that findings from this qualitative study could give consultants entry into what happens below the surface in the silos' unconscious. Research design, approach and method: A qualitative and descriptive research design using a case study strategy was used. Data gathering consisted of 25 narrative interviews. Using discourse analysis four themes manifested, integrated into four working hypotheses and a research hypothesis. Trustworthiness and ethical standards were ensured. Main findings: Themes that emerged were the physical environment and structure, intra-group relations, experiences of management, and intergroup relations. Practical/managerial implications: Consulting on silo behaviour as physical structures only may not be successful in changing organisational behaviour. The silo resembles an iceberg - the largest part is below the surface. Contribution/value-add: The findings evidenced silo behaviour to be an unconscious phenomenon influencing team identity negatively. Consultants are urged to study these manifestations towards understanding silos and their effect on team identity better. © 2012. The Authors.},

Then, the paper goes into details about the problem of defining a suitable middleware architecture to support coordination activities in applications including active documents and mobile agents, by specifically focusing on the role played by XML technologies in that context. A simple taxonomy is introduced to characterise coordination middleware architectures depending on the way they exploit XML documents in supporting coordination. The characteristics of several middleware infrastructures are then surveyed and evaluated, also with the help of a simple example scenario in the area of distributed workflow management. This analysis enables us to identify the advantages and the shortcomings of the different approaches, and the basic requirements of a middleware for XML-centric applications.},

Through text analysis of hundreds of design concepts across a dozen different design challenges on a Web-based innovation platform that tracks connections to sources of inspiration, we find that citing sources is associated with greater creativity of ideas, but conceptually closer rather than farther sources appear more beneficial. This inverse relationship between conceptual distance and design creativity is robust across different design problems on the platform.

	volume = {8658},
	abstract = {The design of collaborative learning (CL) scenarios that increase both students' learning and motivation is a challenge that the CSCL community has been addressing in the past few years. On one hand, CSCL design (i.e. scripts) has been shown to be effective to support meaningful interactions and better learning. On the other hand, scripted collaboration often does not motivate students to participate in the CL process, which makes more difficult the use of group activities over time. To deal with the problem of motivation, researchers and educators are now looking at gamification techniques to engage students. Gamification is an interesting concept that deals with the introduction and use of game design elements in a proper way to satisfy individual motivational needs. The use of gamification in educational settings is a complex task that requires, from instructional designers, knowledge about game elements (such as leaderboards and point systems), game design (e.g. how to combine game elements) and their impact on motivation and learning. Today, to the best of our knowledge, there are no approaches for the formal systematization of the instructional design knowledge about gamification and its application in CL scenarios. Thus, to address this issue, we have applied ontological engineering techniques to develop an Ontology called OntoGaCLeS. In this paper, we present the main concepts and ontological structure used to represent gamified CL scenarios. In this ontology, we formalize the representation of gamification concepts and explain how they affect motivation in the context of collaborative learning. Particularly, we will focus on the definition of player roles and gameplay strategies. Furthermore, to show the utility of our approach, we illustrate how to use our ontology to define a personalized gamification model that is used to gamify a CL scenario based on motivational needs and individual traits of learners in a group.},

	abstract = {The use of Computer-Support Collaborative Learning (CSCL) scripts is an effective approach to support meaningful interactions and better collaborative learning (CL). Unfortunately, in some situations, scripted collaboration decreases the motivation and engagement of students, which makes more difficult to use it over time. To deal with this problem, we propose the use of gamification as Persuasive Technology (PT) to induce the students to follow the intended learning behavior specified by CSCL scripts, with a positive change in the learners' attitude. Nevertheless, to achieve this goal, it is necessary an exhaustive knowledge on gamification and its impact on CL. Thus, we are developing an ontology to provide a formal systematization of the knowledge on gamification and its proper application in CL scenarios. In this paper, we focus in the formalization of basic concepts related to gamification as a PT in CL scenarios. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in CL scenarios, we present a case study, where we built and apply a personalized gamification model based on the ontological structures defined in this work.},

	abstract = {Developers base selection of a User Interface (UI) development approach on functionality, development and maintenance costs, usability, responsiveness, etc. User expectations continue to grow for greater functionality and continuous interactivity, extending demands on computational resources. To facility scale, recent approaches push more UI computation to clients. Such client-side delegation of functionality increase, continuous usage, and localized computation create ever-growing energy demands, which may negatively impact battery life on mobile platforms. Nonetheless, developers given little attention to the power demands aspects of UI framework selection. We evaluate the impact of contemporary UI framework selection on resource utilization and energy consumption. We suggest an alternative delivery approach designed to preserve low energy demands on clients while still allowing offloading of computation from server to client. Our work focuses on web-based mobile applications; however, we believe our approach to energy demand reduction and framework evaluation to be generally applicable.},

In NXT, annotations are described by types and attribute value pairs, and can relate to signal via start and end times, to representations of the external environment, and to each other via either an arbitrary graph structure or a multi-rooted tree structure characterized by both temporal and structural orderings. Simple queries in NXT express variable bindings for n-tuples of objects, optionally constrained by type, and give a set of conditions on the n-tuples combined with boolean operators. The defined operators for the condition tests allow full access to the timing and structural properties of the data model. A complex query facility passes variable bindings from one query to another for filtering, returning a tree structure. In addition to describing NXTȁ9s core data handling and search capabilities, we explain the stand-off XML data storage format that it employs and illustrate its use with examples from an early adopter of the technology.},

To determine the most suitable adaptation action(s), the methodology is based on the formulation and solution of a linear programming problem, which is derived from a behavioral model of the system updated at runtime by a monitoring activity.

Information Science Information science deals with the problems of in-formation handling in the modern world. It is concerned with the structure and properties of information items, the techniques for information handling, the characteris-tics of information processing devices, and the design and operation of information handling systems. The main information handling operations are the production and collection of information items, starting with their initial generation; the analysis and transforma-tion of information, including editing, printing, and/or publishing, as well as indexing, cataloging, abstracting, and summarizing of information; the organization and storage of information, including classification and de-posit in data banks, libraries, and information repositories; the encoding and transmission of information from origi-nating points to desired destinations; and finally, the retrieval of information in response to information requests, and the dissemination of the retrieved data. ally be used to carry out all information processing and dissemination tasks selectively, rapidly, and cheaply. A detailed response could include evidence of advances in our understanding of the underlying structures of the in-formation which computing devices are called upon to process. Furthermore, recent hardware and software developments could be cited leading to the experimentM implementation of so-called computer utilities; such utilities may eventually offer computing and data process-ing services on demand to large user classes who may be situated in locations remote from the central equipment. The experiments recently conducted with such time-shar-ing systems lead to the conclusion that the {\textasciitilde}dvent of mechanized networks of data banks and information centers, accessible from many points by many users, may not be so far in the future as might have otherwise been expected. The information science curriculum should then lead to an examination of the principal technical and intellec-tual problems arising in information science, and to a description of various proposed procedures for processing information by automatic or semi-automatic methods. The field may be subdivided into three main parts: (a) the study of information and data structures, includ-ing in particular the structure of programming and nat-ural languages; (b) the study of computer organizations and operating systems of the kind providing simultaneous service to several types of user classes; (c) the study of automatic text processing systems in-cluding text analysis and classification systems, as well as systems for information retrieval and dissemination.

	abstract = {Gamification is increasingly being used as a way to increase student engagement, motivate and promote learning and facilitate the development of sustainable life skills. Findings from research carried out to date on the effectiveness of gamification in educational contexts can be summarised as cautiously optimistic. However, researchers warn that further and more nuanced research is needed. It is generally accepted that matching an individual's learning style with the appropriate form of an instructional intervention significantly impacts upon the performance of the student and his/her achievement of learning outcomes. It is also widely acknowledged that personality traits have a significant impact on academic achievement. Knowing how individual characteristics will impact on the experience of gamification will inform the effective design of gamified learning interventions and enable its effective integration into the learning environment. This research examines the impact that different learning styles and personality traits have on students'; (1) perceptions of, (2) engagement with and, (3) overall performance in a gamified learning intervention developed using a prediction market. The study evidences a range of responses to gamification based upon individual learning styles and personality traits. Findings suggest that individuals who are orientated towards active or global learning styles have a positive impression of gamification. Other results suggest that extraverted individuals like gamification, while conscientious individuals are less motivated by it. These findings have important implications for practitioners deploying gamification. The key conclusion is that, as a tool for influencing individuals and mediating learning behaviours, gamification must be investigated and deployed in a nuanced manner with due regard paid to issues such as individual learning styles and personality traits.},

Findings support that understanding the assessment criteria is complex, mainly because of its terminology. However the discussion of exemplars can have a crucial role in this process. In order to operationalize the assessment criteria, students used strategies stemming from the social context (teacher, peers and other didactic sources) as well as from their individual experience (errors made, engagement in critical thinking and the creation of a favorable environment). However it also showed that some differences in operationalizing the assessment criteria were related to different students' profile. The results point to a multi-strategy pedagogical approach to enhance students' internalization of assessment criteria. Nevertheless reducing the tension between teachers' expectations and students' own standards of quality showed to be a complex process.},

	abstract = {roland b unken, tina seufert, and fred paas the problem of cognitive load measurement: what are good cognitive load indicators? The previous chapters have outlined the basic theoretical assumptions for cognitive load theory (Chapter 2), described how cognitive load affects the process of schema acquisition (Chapter 3), and discussed the role that learners' individual differences play in the process of knowledge construc-tion (Chapter 4). The central problem identified by Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) is that learning is impaired when the total amount of processing requirements exceeds the limited capacity of human working memory. In addition to the fundamental assumption that learning is a function of available cognitive resources, CLT makes some additional assumptions with respect to the relation among cognitive resources, demands, and learn-ing. The first of these additional assumptions is that instructional design and/or methods may induce either a useful (germane) or a wasteful (extra-neous) consumption of cognitive capacity. The second assumption is that the source of cognitive load can also vary depending on the complexity of the task to-be-solved (intrinsic cognitive load defined by element inter-activity). There is a large body of empirical research supporting the assump-tions of CLT by analyzing the relation between the factors influencing cognitive load and learning outcomes. For example, several empirically well-established instructional design principles (Mayer, 2005) were identi-fied in that line of research, which are discussed in other chapters of this book (see Chapters 7, 8). However, can CLT's assumptions be verified directly? Are there valid and reliable methods to test the complex interactions between the learner's cognitive resources, demands, and learning? In this chapter, we describe and discuss the various measures of cognitive load currently available.},

	abstract = {XML is successful as a machine processable data interchange format, but it is often too verbose for human use. For this reason, many XML languages permit an alternative more legible non-XML syntax. XSLT stylesheets are often used to convert from the XML syntax to the alternative syntax; however, such transformations are not reversible since no general tool exists to automatically parse the alternative syntax back into XML. We present XSugar, which makes it possible to manage dual syntax for XML languages. An XSugar specification is built around a context-free grammar that unifies the two syntaxes of a language. Given such a specification, the XSugar tool can translate from alternative syntax to XML and vice versa. Moreover, the tool statically checks that the transformations are reversible and that all XML documents generated from the alternative syntax are valid according to a given XML schema.},

	volume = {22},
	doi = {10.1007/s00778-013-0326-x},
	abstract = {Exploratory search is an information seeking behavior where users progressively learn about one or more topics of interest; it departs quite radically from traditional keyword-based query paradigms, as it combines query-ing and browsing of resources, and covers activities such as investigating, evaluating, comparing, and synthesizing retrieved information. In most cases, such activities are enabled by a conceptual description of information in terms of entities and their semantic relationships. Customized Web applications, where few applicative entities and their rela-tionships are embedded within the application logics, typ-ically provide some support to exploratory search, which is, however, specific for a given domain. In this paper, we describe a general-purpose exploratory search framework, i.e., a framework which is neutral to the application logic. Our contribution consists of the formalization of the exploratory search paradigm over Web data sources, accessed by means of services; extracted information is described by means of an entity-relationship schema, which masks the service implementations. Exploratory interaction is supported by a general-purpose user interface including a set of widgets for This work has been done in the context of the Search Computing (SeCo) research project funded by the European Research Council (ERC) IDEAS Advanced Grants. data exploration, from big tables to atomic tables, visual dia-grams, and geographic maps; the user interaction is translated to queries defined in SeCoQL, a SQL-like language and pro-tocol specifically designed for supporting exploratory search over data sources. We illustrate the software architecture of our prototype, which uses the interplay of a query and result management system with an orchestrator, capable of incre-mentally building queries and of walking through the past navigation history. The distinctive feature of the framework is the ability to extract top solutions, which combine top-ranked entity instances. We evaluate exploratory search from the end-user perspective in the context of a cognitive model for search, by studying the user's behavior and the effec-tiveness of exploratory search in terms of quality of results produced by the search process; we also compare the effec-tiveness of interaction in using our multi-domain search sys-tem with the use of various replicas of the system, each acting upon a single domain, and with the use of conventional search engines.},

We sought to define a generalized approach for radiology reporting that produces flexible outline-style reports, accommodates structured information and named reporting elements, allows reporting terms to be linked to controlled vocabularies, uses existing informatics standards, and allows structured report data to be extracted readily. We applied the Regular Language for XML-Next Generation (RELAX NG) schema language to create templates for 110 reporting templates created as part of the Radiological Society of North America reporting initiative. We evaluated how well this approach addressed the project's goals. The RELAX NG schema language expressed the cardinality and hierarchical relationships of reporting concepts, and allowed reporting elements to be mapped to terms in controlled medical vocabularies, such as RadLex®, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms®, and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes®. The approach provided extensibility and accommodated the addition of new features. Overall, the approach has proven to be useful and will form the basis for a supplement to the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine Standard.},

Also limited is the support for the representation and documentation of sign language video resources in terms of sign writing systems. In this paper, we start with a brief survey of existing sign language technologies and we assess their state of the art from the perspective of a sign language digital information processing system.We then introduce our work, focusing on visionbased sign language recognition.We apply the factorisation method to sign language videos in order to factor out the signer's motion from the structure of the hands. We then model the motion of the hands in terms of a weighted combination of linear trajectory basis and apply a set of classifiers on the basis weights for the purpose of recognising meaningful phonological elements of sign language. We demonstrate how these classification results can be used for transcribing sign videos into a written representation for annotation and documentation purposes.

	abstract = {© 2017 Association for Computing Machinery. Digital copies of musical scores may be saved on tablet devices, compressing volumes of scores into a single portable device. Tablet screens are however typically smaller than printed sheet music such that the score needs to be resized for readability. This necessitates additional page turning which is made more complex when repeat instructions are used since these give rise to forward and backward page turns of the music. In this paper, we tackle this problem by first performing image analysis of the score in order to identify repeat instructions and hence flatten the score. Thus, the music player is presented the score as it should be played.We then propose the use of eye-gaze tracking to provide a hands-free page turning mechanism. Thus, the player remains in full control of when the page turn occurs. Through a preliminary study, we found that our proposed score flattening and eye-gaze page turning reduced the time spent navigating the page turns by 47\% in comparison to available music score reading tools.},

	abstract = {Keyword extraction is a common technique in the domain of information retrieval. Keywords serve as a minimalistic summary for single documents or document collections, enabling the reader to quickly perceive the main contents of a text. However, they are often not readily available for the documents of interest. Common keyword extraction techniques demand either a large data collection, a learning process, or access to extensive amounts of reference data. By relying on additional linguistic features (e.g. stop word removal), most approaches are language-restricted. Moreover, the extracted keywords usually pertain to the entire document, rather than only to the portion that is of interest to the reader. In this paper, we present an efficient and flexible approach to summarize selections of text within a document. Our solution is based on a keyword extraction algorithm that is applicable to a variety of documents, regardless of language or context. This algorithm relies on the Helmholtz principle and extends a recently presented approach. Our extension covers the features of a weighting algorithm while providing a self-regulation capability to allow for more meaningful results. Furthermore, our approach takes into account the document structure in order to enhance pure statistic summarizations. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach and present results with meaningful examples. In addition, we outline further applications of our approach that allow for enhanced document perception as well as for meaningful document indexing and retrieval. © 2011 ACM.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is becoming more popular as a means to support student learning in higher education by requiring students to prepare before lectures and actively engaging students during lectures. While some research has been conducted into student performance in the flipped classroom, students' study behaviour throughout a flipped course has not been investigated. This study explored students' study behaviour throughout a flipped and a regular course by means of bi-weekly diaries. Furthermore, student references to their learning regulation were explored in course evaluations. Results from the diaries showed that students' study behaviour in the flipped course did not appear to be very different from that of students in a regular course. Furthermore, study behaviour did not appear strongly related to student performance in both the flipped and the regular course. Exploration of student references to their learning regulation in the course evaluations showed that some students experienced the flipped course design as intended to support their learning process. Other students, however, demonstrated resistance to changing their study behaviour even though changing study behaviour is expected in order to benefit from the flipped classroom. Further research on the relationship between students' learning regulation and actual study behaviour and course results is necessary to understand when and why implementing the flipped classroom is successful. Recommendations that may help more effective flipped classroom implementation include considering the prior history between students and instructor(s), the broader curriculum context, and frequent expectation communication especially with large numbers of students and non-mandatory lecture attendance.},

This project used a form of Kelly’s repertory grid method to examine the characteristics that 24 experienced UK assessors notice in distinguishing between students’ performance in four contrasting subject disciplines: that is their implicit assessment criteria. Variation in the choice, ranking and scoring of criteria was evident. Inspection of the individual construct scores in a sub-sample of academic historians revealed five factors in the use of criteria that contribute to marking inconsistency. The results imply that, whilst more effective and social marking processes that encourage sharing of standards in institutions and disciplinary communities may help align standards, assessment decisions at this level are so complex, intuitive and tacit that variability is inevitable. We conclude that universities should be more honest with themselves and with students, and actively help students to understand that application of assessment criteria is a complex judgement and there is rarely an incontestable interpretation of their meaning.},

A high proportion of the tutors did not make use of written criteria in their marking and, where they were used, it was largely a post hoc process in refining, checking or justifying a holistic decision. Norm referencing was also found to be an important part of the grading process despite published criteria. The authors develop the notion of tutors’ standards frameworks, influenced by students’ work, and providing the interpretive lens used to decide grades.

Researchers actively discuss how a paper should be organized to be accepted in mainstream conferences. Aiming: This work tackles the problem of generalizing and characterizing the type of papers accepted at SE conferences. Method: The paper offers a new perspective in the analysis of SE literature: a categorization scheme for SE papers is obtained by merging, extending and revising related proposals from a few existing studies.

	abstract = {XML is becoming a standard for data communication over the Internet. Like HTML, it is a markup language, but it supports a richer set of features, such as user-defined tags that allow both data and descriptive information about data to be represented within a single document. At the same time, presentation aspects remain decoupled from data representation. XML's flexibility lets it serve as a metalanguage for defining other markup languages specialized for specific contexts. A document type definition (DTD) describes the tags documents can use, customized to the specific semantic requirements of the application context, and the rules connecting tags with their contents. These capabilities make XML a common data format for data interchange between computer systems and between applications. XML's proliferation raises the question of how data transferred by XML documents can be read, stored, and queried. In other words, how can database management systems (DBMSs) handle XML documents?},

	abstract = {The Semantic Web drives towards the use of the Web for interacting with logically interconnected data. Through knowledge models such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying representation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies the use of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert anything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web environment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified variables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the Web, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of N3Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same language can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N3Logic and illustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web.},

The objective was to find out how mind maps are structured and which information they contain. The results include: A typical mind map is rather small, with 31 nodes on average (median), whereas each node usually contains between one to three words. In 66.12\% of cases there are few notes, if any, and the number of hyperlinks tends to be rather low, too, but depends upon the mind mapping application. Most mind maps are edited only on one (60.76\%) or two days (18.41\%). It is to expect that a typical user creates around 2.7 mind maps (mean) a year. However, there are exceptions which create a long tail. One user created 243 mind maps, the largest mind map contained 52,182 nodes, one node contained 7,497 words and one mind map was edited on 142 days. © 2011 ACM.},

	abstract = {One of the main services that Adaptive Systems offer to their users is the provision of content that is tailored to individual user's needs. Some Adaptive Systems use a closed corpus content that has been prepared for them a priori, hence, they accept only a narrow field of content. Furthermore, the content is tightly coupled with other parts of the system, which also hinders its re-usability. To address these limitations, recent systems started to make use of open Web content to provide a wider variety of content. Previous approaches have attempted to harness the information available on the web by providing adaptive systems with customizable information objects. Since adaptive systems are evolving towards the Semantic Web and the use of ontologies, existing systems are limited by their ability to service these documents solely through keyword-based queries. In this research we propose a novel framework that extends existing content provision system, Slicepedia. Our framework uses the conceptual representation of content to segment it in a semantic manner. The framework removes unnecessary content from web pages, such as navigation bars, and then semantically reveals the structural representation of text to build a tree-like hierarchy. This tree can be traversed to obtain different levels of content granularity that facilitate content discoverability and adaptivity.},

The precise function and nature of layout has not, however, been suf addressed within computational approaches; attention is often restricted to relatively local issues of typography and text-formatting, leaving broader issues of layout unaddressed. In this paper we focus on the selection and function of layout in pages that appropriately combine textual and graphical representation styles to yield coherent presentation designs. We demonstrate that layout offers a rich resource for achieving presentational coherence, alongside more traditional resources such as text-formatting and the text-internal marking of discourse connections. We also introduce an integrated approach to layout, text, and diagram generation. Our approach is developed on the basis of a preliminary empirical investigation of professionally produced layouts, followed by implementation within a prototype information system in the area of art history.},

As a result, the PSP can perform an interesting variety of processes using a very small operation set.

Also, the U.K.A.E.A. (A.E.E., Winfrith) have written a program, CONFLAG, for the I B M 1401, which scans a routine and points out the places where alteration may be needed.

We have concentrated in this report on the Fortran source language, and excluded discussion of the operating systems (e.g. Fortran Monitor System). There is a logical distinction between these two, and we think it desirable not to obscure it. One of the reasons is that the operating system is considerably more machine dependent, as it must allow explicit reference to the particular input/ output equipment of the computer. The various systems concerned are similar in outline, providing compilation or assembly of independent routines, and optional loading and execution.

With the Net Generation representing nearly 7\% of the population today (Bartlett 2005) and with nearly 49.5 million students enrolled in schools in 2003 (Enrollment Management Report 2005), responding to the specific needs of this generation of learners is becoming increasingly important. The challenge of evolving pedagogy to meet the needs of Net-savvy students is daunting, but educators are assisted by the fact that this generation values education. These students learn in a different way than their predecessors did, but they do want to learn. In this article we will define the characteristics of Net Geners' learning styles and discuss how educators can make the most of these particular traits.},

Part of the success of technology and education is due to the capacity technology can adapt teaching and learning to different contexts.

However, we do not know if the use of these elements brings the promised results. In this paper, we conducted an observational analysis focusing in XP (experience points) and Badges, checking their correlation with the students learning, in order to investigate the influence of these gamification elements.},

	volume = {89},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jnca.2017.01.024},
	abstract = {The term IoT emerging services is used to refer to the modern kinds of services that IoT can provide to enhance service and experience quality by reducing complexity, speeding up requests, and using techniques involved with cloud, Big Data, and protocols to allows services to function seamlessly. Therefore, IoT utilises protocols found within different network layers. RPL or Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks is one of the most important routing protocols utilised on the network layer. This protocol is considered an IPV6 distance vector proactive routing protocol. The trickle timer algorithm is one of its major components. This algorithm is used to control and track the control messages' flow throughout the network. However, one weakness of the trickle algorithm is that it suffers from short listen problem that makes some nodes starve for delay and long latency in propagating transmissions. Based on existing literature, there have been several research studies on this trickle method. Development of the Enhanced Trickle algorithm (E-Trickle) was done to get rid of the listen only period. However, there still is relatively low activity on studying the trickle algorithm's performance merits. Our proposed elastic trickle timer algorithm will try to fill this gap by dealing only with the listen to only period problems. The power consumption and convergence time are mainly affected. Therefore, our proposed algorithm was incorporated in the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Different network densities were used to evaluate the simulation experiments. Its implementation was done on 20, 40, 60, and 80 nodes using different ratios for reception success (RX) (20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\%), and grid network and random topologies were used. The Cooja 2.7 simulator was used to implement the simulation experiments, and RPL performance was studied through the elastic trickle timer algorithm. Measurement of the simulation experiments was done on various performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), convergence time, and power consumption. Comparison of the results was done using the standard trickle timer algorithm. Using random and grid topologies, the results revealed greater enhancements in terms of convergence time. Simulation results revealed that when the network was made up of 20 nodes, there was 35\% less convergence time. Moreover, when 40 nodes were randomly placed, there was 62\% less convergence time, and 71\% less convergence time when 40 nodes were situated in a grid topology. Additionally, there was 70\% less convergence time when the network was made up of 60 nodes and approximately 76\% less convergence time when there were 80 nodes. Moreover, the simulation results revealed that in terms of energy consumption, the new algorithm exhibited superior performance characteristics.},

	abstract = {Summaries of meetings are very important as they convey the essential content of discussions in a concise form. Generally, it is time consuming to read and understand the whole documents. Therefore, summaries play an important role as the readers are interested in only the important context of discussions. In this work, we address the task of meeting document summarization. Automatic summarization systems on meeting conversations developed so far have been primarily extractive, resulting in unacceptable summaries that are hard to read. The extracted utterances contain disfluencies that affect the quality of the extractive summaries. To make summaries much more readable, we propose an approach to generating abstractive summaries by fusing important content from several utterances. We first separate meeting transcripts into various topic segments, and then identify the important utterances in each segment using a supervised learning approach. The important utterances are then combined together to generate a one-sentence summary. In the text generation step, the dependency parses of the utterances in each segment are combined together to create a directed graph. The most informative and well-formed sub-graph obtained by integer linear programming (ILP) is selected to generate a one-sentence summary for each topic segment. The ILP formulation reduces disfluencies by leveraging grammatical relations that are more prominent in non-conversational style of text, and therefore generates summaries that is comparable to human-written abstractive summaries. Experimental results show that our method can generate more informative summaries than the baselines. In addition, readability assessments by human judges as well as log-likelihood estimates obtained from the dependency parser show that our generated summaries are significantly readable and well-formed.},

This growth has created a huge demand for automatic methods and tools for text summarization. We can think of automatic summa- rization as a type of information compression. To achieve such compression, better modelling and understanding of document structures and internal relations is required. In this article, we develop a novel approach to extractive text summarization by modelling texts and documents as small- world networks. Based on our recent work on the detection of unusual behavior in text, we model a document as a one- parameter family of graphs with its sentences or paragraphs defining the vertex set and with edges defined by Helmholtz’s principle. We demonstrate that for some range of the param- eters, the resulting graph becomes a small-world network. Such a remarkable structure opens the possibility of apply- ing many measures and tools from social network theory to the problem of extracting the most important sentences and structures from text documents. We hope that documents will be also a new and rich source of examples of complex networks.},

In order to alleviate these concerns, whilst maintaining security, ease of access and distribution, we propose a PHR format that utilizes and extends a secure composite document format, Publicly Posted Composite Documents [1], originally designed for cross-organizational business workflows. The proposed PHR ensures data is always encrypted whilst traversing non-secure channels, with fine-grained access control built in to enable multiple people to have differential access to the same PHR. End-to-end encryption using Password Key Derivation Functions ensures no central authority is required to have access to plaintext data or decryption keys. This allows safe cooperation with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who act as the primary storage and vehicle by which PHRs can be shared. Our PHRs are designed to be partially downloaded and exported on r equest, and to gather PHR formatted data securely from an ecosystem of healthcare devices.},

	abstract = {This paper presents and discusses the internal operation of NCLSC (NCL Stereo Converter): a tool to convert a 2D interactive multimedia application annotated with depth information to a stereoscopic-multimedia application. Stereoscopic-multimedia applications are those that codify both the left-eye and right-eye views, as required by stereoscopic 3D displays. NCLSC takes as input an NCL (Nested Context Language) document and outputs an NCL stereoscopic application codified in side-by-side or top-bottom format (both common input formats for 3DTV sets). NCL is the declarative language adopted in most Latin America countries for terrestrial digital TV middleware systems and the ITU-T H.761 Recommendation for IPTV services. However, the proposed approach is not restricted to NCL and can be used by other languages. The depth annotation allows for positioning each 2D graphical component in a layered (2.5D or 2D+depth) user interface. It is used by NCLSC to compute the screen parallax (offset) between the graphical elements in the left and right views of the resulting stereoscopic application. When the resulting application is presented on stereoscopic 3D displays, such screen parallax induces retinal disparity, which creates the illusion of floating flat-2D graphical elements. NCLSC does not require any additional native middleware support to run in currently available 3D-enabled TV sets. Moreover, NCLSC can adapt, at run-time, the output application to different display sizes, viewer distances, and viewer preferences, which are usually required for a proper balance between artistic effects and user experience. © 2015 ACM.},

In a set of studies we examined the effects of points, a basic element of gamification, on performance in a computerized assessment of mastery and fluency of basic mathematics concepts. The first study, with adult participants, found no effect of the point manipulation on accuracy of responses, although the speed of responses increased. In a second study, with 6-8 grade middle school participants, we found the same results for the two aspects of performance. In addition, middle school participants' reactions to the test revealed higher likeability ratings for the test under the points condition, but only in the first of the two sessions, and perceived effort during the test was higher in the points condition, but only for eighth grade students.},

	abstract = {We describe a procedure for constructing a website for pub-lishing open data by focusing on the case of Open DATA METI, a website of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry of Japan. We developed two sites for publishing open data: a data catalog site and one for searching linked open data (LOD). The former allows users to find relevant data they want to use, and the latter allows them to utilize the found data by connecting them. To implement the data catalog site, we constructed a site tailored to the needs of the organization. Then we extracted a large amount of metadata from the individual open data and put it on the site.

Ohmukai, H. Takeda have taken a lot of time if we had used the existing methods, so we devised our own solutions for them. To implement the LOD searching site, we con-verted the data into LOD in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). We focused on converting statistical data into tables, which are widely used. Re-garding the conversion, there were several kinds of missing information that we needed to associate with the data in the tables. We created a template for incorporating the necessary information for LOD in the original table. The conversion into LOD was automatically done using the template.},

	abstract = {This paper illustrates a new approach to automatic re-authoring of web pages for rendering on small-screen devices. The approach is based on auto-matic detection of the device type and screen size from the HTTP request header to render a desktop web page or a transformed one for display on small screen devices, for example, PDAs. Known algorithms (transforms) are employed to reduce the size of page elements, to hide parts of the text, and to transform tables into text while preserving the structural format of the web page. The system comprises a preprocessor that works offline and a just-in-time handler that responds to HTTP requests. The preprocessor employs Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to set default attributes for the page and prepares it for the handler. The latter is responsible for downsizing graphical elements in the page, converting tables to text, and inserting visibility attributes and JavaScript code to allow the user of the client device to interact with the page and cause parts of the text to disappear or reap-pear. A system was developed that implements the ap-proach and was used it to collect performance results and conduct usability testing. The importance of the approach lies in its ability to display hidden parts of the web page without having to revisit the server, thus reducing user wait times considerably, saving battery power, and cutting down on wireless network traffic.},

Innovating products and improvising their quality has become a major challenge not only for small firms, but even for many larger establishments because of these constraints. This research focuses on how product development can be accelerated by using template systems and thereby allowing more time for innovation to the organizations. Furthermore, comparison of a popular templating system- server side templating is made with a relatively new templating system- client side templating. These templating techniques were applied on a few use cases of the web-application developed and their performance based effect was studied with respect to the level of data interactivity in them. An attempt is made to draw a conclusion as to what templating system would be best suited for the development of web applications keeping in mind the limited budget and at the same time maximizing the performance of the web application and dealing with premature scalability issues.},

	abstract = {Templates are used to generate all kinds of text, including computer code. The last decade, the use of templates gained a lot of popularity due to the increase of dynamic web applica- tions. Templates are a tool for programmers, and implementations of template engines are most times based on practical experience rather than based on a theoretical background. This book reveals the mathematical background of templates and shows interesting find- ings for improving the practical use of templates. First, a framework to determine the necessary computational power for the template metalanguage is presented. The template metalanguage does not need to be Turing-complete to be useful. A non-Turing-complete metalanguage enforces separation of concerns between the view and model. Second, syn- tactical correctness of all languages of the templates and generated code is ensured. This includes the syntactical correctness of the template metalanguage and the output language. Third, case studies show that the achieved goals are applicable in practice. It is even shown that syntactical correctness helps to prevent cross-site scripting attacks in web applications.

	doi = {10.1145/2700325},
	abstract = {The complexity of systems is considered an obstacle to the progress of the IT industry. Autonomic computing is presented as the alternative to cope with the growing complexity. It is a holistic approach, in which the systems are able to configure, heal, optimize, and protect by themselves. Web-based applications are an example of systems where the complexity is high. The number of components, their interoperability, and workload variations are factors that may lead to performance failures or unavailability scenarios. The occurrence of these scenarios affects the revenue and reputation of businesses that rely on these types of applications. In this article, we present a self-healing framework for Web-based applications (SHõWA). SHõWA is com-posed by several modules, which monitor the application, analyze the data to detect and pinpoint anomalies, and execute recovery actions autonomously. The monitoring is done by a small aspect-oriented programming agent. This agent does not require changes to the application source code and includes adaptive and selec-tive algorithms to regulate the level of monitoring. The anomalies are detected and pinpointed by means of statistical correlation. The data analysis detects changes in the server response time and analyzes if those changes are correlated with the workload or are due to a performance anomaly. In the presence of per-formance anomalies, the data analysis pinpoints the anomaly. Upon the pinpointing of anomalies, SHõWA executes a recovery procedure. We also present a study about the detection and localization of anomalies, the accuracy of the data analysis, and the performance impact induced by SHõWA. Two benchmarking applications, exercised through dynamic workloads, and different types of anomaly were considered in the study. The results reveal that (1) the capacity of SHõWA to detect and pinpoint anomalies while the number of end users affected is low; (2) SHõWA was able to detect anomalies without raising any false alarm; and (3) SHõWA does not induce a significant performance overhead (throughput was affected in less than 1\%, and the response time delay was no more than 2 milliseconds).

Component services are provided by a dedicated layer in the cloud architecture called computer music as a Service (CMaaS). The specialized music services can be integrated into different applications at the same time. These music services provided by the CMaaS layer are implemented in the form of platform images based on templates at the Platform as a Service layer. The images are ready to be loaded into the virtualized infrastructure on demand. As examples of implementation over the proposed cloud architecture, two powerful applications for computer music composition are presented: ''Diatonic Composer'', an interactive composer of scores with high-abstraction music elements, and ''Csound Meets the Cloud'', an assisted algorithmic composer focused on sound synthesis. The composition model, the involved music services and the web application are described for the above mentioned applications.

In practice, fighting mobile phone spam is difficult by several factors, including the lower rate of SMS that has allowed many users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of mobile phone spam-filtering software. On the other hand, in academic settings, a major handicap is the scarcity of public SMS spam datasets, that are sorely needed for validation and comparison of different classifiers. Moreover, as SMS messages are fairly short, content-based spam filters may have their performance degraded. In this paper, we offer a new real, public and non-encoded SMS spam collection that is the largest one as far as we know. Moreover, we compare the performance achieved by several established machine learning methods. The results indicate that Support Vector Machine outperforms other evaluated classifiers and, hence, it can be used as a good baseline for further comparison. © 2011 ACM.},

This article analyzes the traditional journal publishing system, the recent open access models of journal publishing as an evolving phenomenon, the nature and extent of open access as a disruptive innovation, and the implications for key stakeholders. The major finding is that open access publishing has gained traction because technology has contributed to lower publication costs, easier access to research articles, and speedier publishing processes. However, the threat posed by open access has not significantly impacted traditional publishers because of strategies employed by the major publishers and slow adoption of open access by some researchers.

	title = {{DYNAMIC} {WEB} {FORMS} {DEVELOPMENT} {USING} {RULEML}},
	abstract = {Web forms development for Web based applications is often expensive,laborious, error-prone, time consuming and requires a lot of effort. Web forms are used by many different people with different backgrounds and a lot of demands. There is a very high cost associated with the need to update the Web application systems to achieve these demands. A wide range of techniques and ideas to automate the generation of Web forms exist. These techniques and ideas however, are not capable of generating the most dynamic behaviour of form elements, and make Insufficient use of database metadata to control Web forms’ generation and appearance. In this thesis different techniques are proposed that use RuleML and database metadata to build rulebases to improve the automatic and dynamic generation of Web forms. First this thesis proposes the use of a RuleML format rulebase using Reaction RuleML that can be used to support the development of automated Web interfaces. Database metadata can be extracted from system catalogue tables in typical relational database systems, and used in conjunction with the rulebase to produce appropriate Web form elements. Results show that this mechanism successfully insulates application logic from code and suggests that the method can be extended from generic metadata rules to more domain specific rules. Second it proposes the use of common sense rules and domain specific rules rulebases using Reaction RuleML format in conjunction with database metadata rules to extend support for the development of automated Web forms. Third it proposes the use of rules that involve code to implement more semantics for Web forms. Separation between content, logic and presentation of Web applications has become an important issue for faster development and easy maintenance. Just as CSS applied on the client side to control the overall presentation of Web applications, a set of rules can give a similar consistency to the appearance and operation of any set of forms that interact with the same database. We develop rules to order Web form elements and query forms using Reaction RuleML format in conjunction with database metadata rules. The results show the potential of RuleML formats for representing database structural and active semantics. Fourth it proposes the use of a RuleML based approach to provide more support for greater semantics for example advanced domain support even when this is not a DBMS feature. The approach is to specify most of the semantics associated with data stored in RDBMS, to overcome some RDBMSs limitations. RuleML could be used to represent database metadata as an external format.},

Scientiic informa-tion extraction from documents into a structured knowledge graph representation facilitates automated machine understanding of a document's content. Traditional information extraction approaches, that either require training samples or a preexisting knowledge base to assist in the extraction, can be challenging when applied to large repositories of digital documents. Labeled training examples for such large scale are diicult to obtain for such datasets. Also, most available knowledge bases are built from web data and do not have suucient coverage to include concepts found in scientiic articles. In this paper we aim to construct a knowledge graph from schol-arly documents while addressing both these issues. We propose a fully automatic, unsupervised system for scientiic information extraction that does not build on an existing knowledge base and avoids manually-tagged training data. We describe and evaluate a constructed taxonomy that contains over 15k entities resulting from applying our approach to 10k documents.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in technology have enabled a shift to occur in teaching and learning. We are living in a connected world where physical boundaries of attending an institution to gain an education no longer apply. There are currently thousands of courses available online that do not require formal attendance. As such, this era of " open learning " pioneers an innovative research, across multiple disciplines. One domain of knowledge where open learning can be advantageous is within computer science. This industry is now highly in demand and can benefit from open learning platforms, where students may not have the opportunity to formally attend courses but still want to enhance their skills. However, there are some significant limitations in open learning applications: how they assess the quality of learning (i.e., was it just copying or at best learning by rote) or considering individual differences among learners. In this emerging research paper, we posit the idea of an adaptive, crowdsourced, and primarily educational technology, targeted at software development students. The proposed technology caters for either individual or group learning. It differentiates itself from other tutoring and programming support technologies as it will continually monitor and assess students' performance in each phase of the education process.},

Most importantly, the scheme utilizes XML for defining custom tags that are transformed into HTML using the innovative concept of HTML patterns. The scheme was initially implemented as a COM component (PageGen) and later ported to Microsoft .NET. it has proven to be quite effective for Active Server Pages (and ASP.NET) sites used to host online books and course material. However, the scheme is general enough for use with any database-centric site or content as well as being adapted to other web application frameworks such as PHP and JSP. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Web search engines federate such entity-oriented queries to relevant structured databases; the results of those searches are then returned to the user along with web search results. Current federated approaches have two limitations: (i) they often fail to return important results for a broad class of such entity-oriented queries and (ii) the information they return per entity is often inadequate. In this paper, we present the Query Portals system that addresses these limitations. The Query Portals system dynamically generates a portal for an entity-oriented query. It first provides an overview of the relevant entities and further allows users to drill down to gather additional information on these entities. Our architecture uses a judicious combination of pre-processing and query time techniques so that the query portal can be generated efficiently.},

Although change over long intervals has been explored on random (and potentially unvisited) samples of Web pages, little is known about the nature of finer grained changes to pages that are actively consumed by users, such as those in our sample. We describe algorithms, analyses, and models for characterizing changes in Web content, focusing on both time (by using hourly and sub-hourly crawls) and structure (by looking at page-, DOM-, and term-level changes). Change rates are higher in our behavior-based sample than found in previous work on randomly sampled pages, with a large portion of pages changing more than hourly. Detailed content and structure analyses identify stable and dynamic content within each page. The understanding of Web change we develop in this paper has implications for tools designed to help people interact with dynamic Web content, such as search engines, advertising, and Web browsers.},

This approach allows for product authentication even when there is only minimal printing (e.g. on a small label or medallion), supporting a variety of secure document workflows. In this paper, we present an investigation on the influence that the substrate type has on the imperfections of the printing process that are used to derive the character signature. We also make a comparison between two printing processes, dry electro photographic process (laser) and (thermal) inkjet. Understanding the sensitivity of our methods to these factors is important so that we know the limitations of the approach for document forensics.},

The model operates on Document Object Model (DOM) tree of the corresponding HTML document. It evaluates each tree node and associated statistical features like link density and text distribution across the node to predict significance of the node towards overall content provided by the document. Once significance of the nodes is determined, the formatting characteristics like fonts, styles and the position of the nodes are evaluated to identify the nodes with similar formatting as compared to the significant nodes. The proposed hybrid model is derived from two different models, i.e., one is based on statistical features and other on formatting characteristics and achieved the best accuracy. We describe the validity of model with the help of experiments conducted on the standard data sets. The results revealed that the proposed model outperformed other existing content extraction models. We present a browser based implementation of the proposed model as proof of concept and compare the implementation strategy with various state of art implementations. We also discuss various applications of the proposed model with special emphasis on open source intelligence.},

WYSIWYG editors, form builders, mashup editors, and markup authoring tools ease the development of Web Applications. However, more advanced Web Applications require servers-side programming, which is beyond the skills of end-user developers. In this paper, we discuss how declarative languages can simplify Web Application development and empower end-users as Web developers. We first identify nine end-user Web Application development levels ranging from simple visual customization to advanced three-tier programming. Then, we propose expanding the presentation tier to support all aspects of Web Application development. We introduce a unified XForms-based framework—called XFormsDB—that supports both client-side and server-side Web Application development. Furthermore, we make a language extension proposal—called XFormsRTC—for adding true real-time communication capabilities to XForms. We also present XFormsDB Integrated Development Environment (XIDE), which assists end-users in authoring highly interactive data-driven Web Applications. XIDE supports all Web Application development levels and, especially, promotes the transition from markup authoring and snippet programming to single and unified language programming.},

MVC is a quite popular concept in constructing web application. MVC separates application development in main components that constructs an application such as data manipulation, user interface, and other parts that controls the application; so that the usage of th MVC concept can increase the maintenability and code organization. This observation uses Java Server Faces (JSF) framework in implementing MVC on UIN Alauddin Makassar’s library web to analyze if the constructed web simplified the development of a web or the opposite. Result of designing this system require a testing phase and system analysis. For the testing phase, whitebox testing is used on how the software works which are the program procedure (basis path) and the repeative process (looping). Besides using whitebox, this observation also analyzes and compare between architecture model 1 and architecture model 2 or MVC by obtaining one part (module) of the web or system which has been designed then comparing the work system and the time of its development process. By looking at the advantage and the disadvantage, architecture model 2 or MVC is still by far more advanced especially in constructing a big scale system.},

Its safe semantics and automatic memory management make it a prime candidate for programming robust Web services. Although Prolog is commonly seen as a component in a Web application that is either embedded or communicates using a proprietary protocol, we propose an architecture where Prolog communicates to other components in a Web application using the standard HTTP protocol. By avoiding embedding in external Web servers, development and deployment become much easier. To support this architecture, in addition to the transfer protocol, we must also support parsing, representing and generating the key Web document types such as HTML, XML and RDF. This article motivates the design decisions in the libraries and extensions to Prolog for handling Web documents and protocols. The design has been guided by the requirement to handle large documents efficiently. The described libraries support a wide range of Web applications ranging from HTML and XML documents to Semantic Web RDF processing. The benefits of using Prolog for Web-related tasks are illustrated using three case studies. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {— With the advent of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) several model transformation approaches and languages have been developed in the last 5 years. Most of these existing approaches are metamodel-based with metamodels representing both an abstract syntax of the corresponding modeling language and also a data structure for storing models. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for users of modeling languages to develop model transformations, because metamodels do not necessarily define all language concepts explicitly which are available for notation purposes. Therefore, we propose a by-example approach for defining inter-model mappings representing semantic correspondences between con-crete domain models which is more user-friendly then directly specifying model transformation rules or mappings based on the abstract syntax. The inter-model mappings between domain models can be used to generate the model transformation rules, by-example, taking into account the already defined mapping be-tween abstract and concrete syntax elements. With this approach the user's knowledge about the notation of the modeling language is sufficient for the definition of model transformations regarding semantic correspondences. Hence, no detailed knowledge about the metamodel and the model transformation language is re-quired.},

	volume = {65},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.10.003},
	abstract = {This paper presents a model, called Scene-Driver, for the re-use of film and television material. We begin by exploring general issues surrounding the ways in which content can be sub-divided into meaningful units for re-use and how criteria might then be applied to the selection and ordering of these units. We also identify and discuss the different means by which a user might interact with the content to create novel and engaging experiences. The Scene-Driver model has been instantiated using content from an animated children's television series called Tiny Planets, which is aimed at children of 5–7-year old. This type of material, being story-based itself, lends itself particularly well to the application of narrative constraints to scene reordering, to provide coherence to the experience of interacting with the content. We propose an interactive narrative-driven game architecture, in which a user generates novel narratives from existing content by placing ''domino'' like tiles. These tiles act as ''glue'' between scenes and each tile choice dictates certain properties of the next scene to be shown within a game. There are three different game-types, based on three different ways in which tiles can be matched to scenes. We introduce algorithms for generating legal tile-sets for each of these three game-types, which can be extended to include narrative constraints. This ensures that all novel orderings adhere to a minimum narrative plan, which has been identified based on analysis of the Tiny Planets series and on narrative theories. We also suggest ways in which basic narratives can be enhanced by the inclusion of directorial techniques and by the use of more complex plot structures. In our evaluation studies with children in the target age-range, our game compared favourably with other games that the children enjoyed playing.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Search engines are increasingly efficient at identifying the best sources for any given keyword query, and are often able to identify the answer within the sources. Unfortunately, many web sources are not trustworthy, because of erroneous, misleading, biased, or outdated information. In many cases, users are not satisfied with the results from any single source. In this paper, we propose a framework to aggregate query results from different sources in order to save users the hassle of individually checking query-related web sites to corroborate answers. To return the best answers to the users, we assign a score to each individual answer by taking into account the number, relevance and originality of the sources reporting the answer, as well as the prominence of the answer within the sources, and aggregate the scores of similar answers. We conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments of our corroboration techniques on queries extracted from the TREC Question Answering track and from a log of real web search engine queries. Our results show that taking into account the quality of web pages and answers extracted from the pages in a corroborative way results in the identification of a correct answer for a majority of queries.},

	abstract = {Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components are coarse-grained software components that satisfy highlevel requirements by integrating several services and offering several interfaces. They are usually used to build larger systems. The paper proposes an ontology-based recommender system for COTS components, that contributes to COTS-based development by improving COTS components identification. It combines into a single framework information retrieval technologies and knowledge about COTS components and users in order to provide the most relevant COTS components meeting users needs. The recommender system is based on (1) an ontology of COTS components, named ONTOCOTS, that describes COTS components and unifies their heterogeneous descriptions available on the Web, and (2) a user model that represents user preferences and interest domains. The proposed recommender system is broken down on two main processes. The first one is responsible for extracting information about COTS components from COTS repositories and representing it as ONTOCOTS instances. The second one is the recommendation process during which the user query is expanded using the linguistic ontology WordNet, and is used along with the user profile and the domain ontology ODP (Open Directory Project) to generate a formal query. Results list is ranked according to the satisfaction degree of user requirements and preferences. Experimentations show an amelioration in recommendations relevance by placing the relevant COTS components at the top of the recommendation list.},

To enable automated processing of the Web pages, semantic infor-mation such as metadata and tags regarding to each page should be added to it. Several authoring tools have been developed to help users tackling this task. However, manual or semi-automatic authoring is implausible when we intend to annotate large amount of Web pages. In this work, we proposed a method to automatically generate some descriptive metadata and tags for a Web page. The idea is to apply the self-organizing map algorithm to cluster the Web pages and discover the relationships between these clusters. In the mean time, the themes of each cluster are also identified. We then use such relationships and themes to tag the Web pages and generate metadata for the Web pages. The result of experiments shows that our method may generate semantically relevant metadata and tags for the Web pages.},

Secondly, how can domain ontology help in establishing user models, analyzing user query, and assisting and guiding interface usage? Finally, how can the intention and focus of a user be correctly extracted? Our work features an template-based linguistic processing technique for developing ontological interface agents; a nature lan-guage query mode, along with an improved keyword-based query mode; and an assistance and guidance for human–machine interaction.

New application requirements have to be introduced rapidly, often without stopping the running application process. Moreover, in many cases the same business logic has to be presented to different channels and/or user interfaces. In this paper we present a dynamic page template architecture for decomposing configurable and representational fragments of the application from the business logic. Page templates consist of static XML files and of dynamic class definitions. The XML-based page templates can be used for declarative definitions of configurable fragments, say, by the end-user with a graphical tool. The page template classes can be used for behavior specification, say, for defining common styles of decoration of the presented pages. Both parts are dynamically loaded into the web application environment and composed with the web objects. Thus, the configurable and representational fragments of web objects are dynamically generated from the changeable and extensible descriptions in the page templates. The concepts presented are applied in various larger software systems. We will present a highly customizable conference management system as an example case.},

The focus is on advertising text, for these issues are treated in reference to the management of the persona's paradoxical components to achieve authenticity. The paper begins by defining authenticity in advertismg and goes on to treat the persona as the sponsor's representative in narrated messages. This discussion links advertising with its literary antecedents in order to illustrate the relationship between authenticity and the within-ad persona. The paper next considers the persona's paradoxical components -real-ity/fictionality, originality/reproducibility, and revelation/ concealment. The postmodern theory of complementarity is proposed as a means for understanding the coexistence of these paradoxical opposites. Last, the paper suggests areas for future research on consumer perceptions of authenticity, global advertising and the consumer response known as " sus-pension of disbelief. " The concerted effort of a culture or of a segment of a culture to achieve authenticity generates its own conventions, its generalities, its commonplaces, its maxims, what Sartre, taking the word from Heidegger, calls the " gabble " (Trilling 1972, p. 105).

            This article systematically explores key theoretical and political, and epistemological and methodological considerations regarding men undertaking feminist fieldwork and research. This has become increasingly relevant as men working on exploring the gendered analysis of armed conflict and peacebuilding has become relatively routine recently. Yet, there is a dearth of systematic research on this topic. To fill this gap, this article asks two central questions: Can men do feminist fieldwork and research in conflict/post-conflict settings? What are the requirements for this? Drawing from my experience as a heterosexual cis male doing fieldwork on female combatants in a post-conflict setting in Nepal (2017–2018) and building on the long-standing robust scholarly conversation on desirability and possibility of men in feminist research and activism, the article argues that critical self-reflexivity with honesty on limitation and partiality of research, situated knowledge, and positionality and power including ethics of care, moral responsibility, and reciprocity are key considerations for men to engage in feminist fieldwork and research. While gender is a primary concern for men researching on women, there is “multiplex subjectivity” (race, class, caste, ethnicity, nationality, and education) interacting with gender creating complex relational power dynamics before/during/after the fieldwork to influence the research process and outcome.},

'Deep work' is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. Coined by the author on his popular blog Study Hacks, deep work will make you better at what you do, achieve more in less time and provide the sense of true fulfilment that comes from mastery of a skill. In short, deep work is like a superpower in our increasingly competitive economy.

And yet most people, whether knowledge workers in noisy open-plan offices or creatives struggling to sharpen their vision, have lost the ability to go deep - spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realising there's a better way.

A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories - from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air - and surprising suggestions, such as the claim that most professionals should quit social media and that everyone should practise being bored. Deep Work will point the way to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.},

	title = {Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of sodware errors},
	abstract = {The work described in this thesis is the result of a research program
started in 1981 to find better ways of programming Telecom applications. These applications are large programs which despite careful
testing will probably contain many errors when the program is put into
service. We assume that such programs do contain errors, and investigate
methods for building reliable systems despite such errors.
The research has resulted in the development of a new programming
language (called Erlang), together with a design methodology, and set of
libraries for building robust systems (called OTP). At the time of writing
the technology described here is used in a number of major Ericsson, and
Nortel products. A number of small companies have also been formed
which exploit the technology.
The central problem addressed by this thesis is the problem of constructing reliable systems from programs which may themselves contain
errors. Constructing such systems imposes a number of requirements on
any programming language that is to be used for the construction. I discuss
these language requirements, and show how they are satisfied by Erlang.
Problems can be solved in a programming language, or in the standard libraries which accompany the language. I argue how certain of the
requirements necessary to build a fault-tolerant system are solved in the
language, and others are solved in the standard libraries. Together these
form a basis for building fault-tolerant sodware systems.
No theory is complete without proof that the ideas work in practice. To
demonstrate that these ideas work in practice I present a number of case
studies of large commercially successful products which use this technology. At the time of writing the largest of these projects is a major Ericsson

applications was fulfilled—I also point to areas where I think the system
could be improved.},

The framework has been evaluated with seven startups, who used the Experimentation Machine over a period of 10 weeks. Our findings confirm that startups benefit from the framework and that it enabled them to quicker unearth (incorrect) assumptions.},

	abstract = {Databases are a key part of any Information System (IS), as they are
concerned with storing and retrieving the data required by the system. Among
the different types of databases, the relational ones are the most widely used.
According to previous works, there are two measures that affect the complexity
of relational databases, the number of foreign keys (NFK) and the depth of the
referential tree (DRT). However, a new kid on the block has appeared in the
last years, the energy consumption of software in general and, therefore, also in
databases.
Bearing this in mind, the aim of this paper is to determine whether the results about the complexity of relational databases are related to the energy consumption of the database. To do that we have measured the energy consumption
required by four different relational database schemas, each one of them representing different values for NFK and DRT. Moreover, we have implemented
and used the four schemas on four different database management systems. As
a result, we can conclude that both measures have a noticeable impact not only
on the complexity but also in the consumption of the database when querying.},

Besides proposing our synthesized checklist method, we found that (i) SE literature reviews use significantly non-indexed Web-of-Science sources; (ii) DBLP only covers a portion of the non-WOS-indexed reference, whereas GS has a more complete coverage of the non-indexed reference in comparison. Preliminary evaluation of the proposed quality assessment point system-based and checklist-based methods shows it to be a viable way to assess quality of the non-indexed and grey literature.},

The step-wise, hands-on approach of DRM studies the ways in which design research can best be undertaken to address specific questions. This study gives rise, for the first time, to a generic and systematic design research methodology intended to improve the quality of design research - its academic credibility, industrial significance and societal contribution - by enabling more thorough, efficient and effective procedures.Professors Blessing and Chakrabarti provide a comprehensive list of types of design research linked to appropriate research methods - familiar as well as new - and supported by illustrative examples throughout the text. Furthermore, the book points the way to more detailed sources of various established research methods that can be applied. The practical emphasis of the text is reinforced by a whole section of design research project examples contributed by eminent design researchers and placed in the context of the proposed methodology to demonstrate the application of the variety of approaches available in a structured fashion.DRM, a Design Research Methodology, speaks to a broad readership: it will provide the graduate student with an excellent grounding in good design research practice, inculcating good habits of research for the future and showing how the process of understanding and improving design can become more effective and efficient; it will interest the academic and industrial researcher as a source of useful and well-ordered methods within a common design research ethos, as well as a methodological framework for research projects and programmes; it will attract the supervisors of young researchers by offering research methods and a well-thought-out and logically structured research process for use in courses on design research.},

Unfortunately, developers lack guidance as to how to improve the energy efficiency of their implementation and which practices are most useful.

In the evaluation we evaluated the degree to which these practices were able to save energy as compared to their unoptimized code counterparts. Our results provide useful guidance for mobile app developers. In particular, we found that bundling network packets up to a certain size and using certain coding practices for reading array length information, accessing class fields, and performing invocations all led to reduced energy consumption. However, other practices, such as limiting memory usage had a very minimal impact on energy usage. These results serve to inform the developer community about specific coding practices that can help lower the overall energy consumption and improve the usability of their applications.},

In this domain, most of state-of-the-art solutions offer limited or constraining approaches to monitor the energy consumption of a device or a process. In this paper, we therefore report on a runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to easily report on the energy consumption of system processes. Concretely, our approach adopts an OS-level library, called PowerAPI, which estimates the power consumption of processes according to different dimensions (CPU, network, etc.). In order to better understand potential energy leaks of legacy software, we use this library to study the impact of programming languages and algorithmic choices on the energy consumption. This preliminary study is based on an empirical evaluation of a eight implementations of the Towers of Hanoi problem. © 2012 IEEE.},

At the same time, the many contextual changes faced by software systems during execution can hamper their functionality and overall quality. To address both problems, self-adaptation approaches can empower software systems, at both design-time and runtime, to adapt to dynamic conditions. In this way, software systems can be more resilient to failure, hence more trustful to satisfy the demands of modern digital society. In this paper, we perform a systematic literature review to study the state-of-the-art on existing self-adaptation approaches for energy efficiency. We analyze the identified approaches from three different perspectives, namely publication trends, application domains, and types of software systems. Our findings can help solution providers to make guided decisions to enable self-adaptability in designing and engineering software systems.},

Here, we address this issue by analyzing a company's strategic documents, with the specific aim of demonstrating the role of sustainability and social responsibility in the text of the annual reports of companies in the IT services industry. We demonstrate that this information is a significant determinant of future economic outcomes. Specifically, here we evaluate sentiment in managerial communication in the area of sustainable business by using collocation analysis of topic and sentiment word lists. Several domain-specific word lists were used for each category monitored. Specifically, Loughran and McDonald's word list was used to measure sentiment in the context of corporate social responsibility and sustainability. The word list that was developed by Pencle and Malaescu was used for CSR, while novel word lists are proposed for sustainability topics. The results of experiments show that the sentiment of sustainability topics (environmental and social in particular) in the annual reports may be a significant indicator of future profitability and thus represent an important information for corporate stakeholders.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.eiar.2018.08.004},
	abstract = {There are no commonly agreed ways to assess the total energy consumption of the Internet. Estimating the Internet's energy footprint is challenging because of the interconnectedness associated with even seemingly simple aspects of energy consumption. The first contribution of this paper is a common modular and layered framework, which allows researchers to assess both energy consumption and CO2e emissions of any Internet service. The framework allows assessing the energy consumption depending on the research scope and specific system boundaries. Further, the proposed framework allows researchers without domain expertise to make such an assessment by using intermediate results as data sources, while analyzing the related uncertainties. The second contribution is an estimate of the energy consumption and CO2e emissions of online advertising by utilizing our proposed framework. The third contribution is an assessment of the energy consumption of invalid traffic associated with online advertising. The second and third contributions are used to validate the first. The online advertising ecosystem resides in the core of the Internet, and it is the sole source of funding for many online services. Therefore, it is an essential factor in the analysis of the Internet's energy footprint. As a result, in 2016, online advertising consumed 20–282 TWh of energy. In the same year, the total infrastructure consumption ranged from 791 to 1334 TWh. With extrapolated 2016 input factor values without uncertainties, online advertising consumed 106 TWh of energy and the infrastructure 1059 TWh. With the emission factor of 0.5656 kg CO2e/kWh, we calculated the carbon emissions of online advertising, and found it produces 60 Mt CO2e (between 12 and 159 Mt of CO2e when considering uncertainty). The share of fraudulent online advertising traffic was 13.87 Mt of CO2e emissions (between 2.65 and 36.78 Mt of CO2e when considering uncertainty). The global impact of online advertising is multidimensional. Online advertising affects the environment by consuming significant amounts of energy, leading to the production CO2e emissions. Hundreds of billions of ad dollars are exchanged yearly, placing online advertising in a significant role economically. It has become an important and acknowledged component of the online-bound society, largely due to its integration with the Internet and the amount of revenue generated through it.},

	title = {Decision {Environments} {To} {Encourage} {More} {Sustainable} {Infrastructure} {Outcomes}},
	url = {http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_dissertations},
	abstract = {Physical infrastructure (i.e. roads, pipelines, airports, dams, landfills, and water treatment systems) contributes directly to sustainability outcomes such as energy and water use and climate changing emissions. The infrastructure built today will likely impact future generations for many years. Planning, design and development decisions about infrastructure are critical to the future performance of these systems. Such decisions about infrastructure are complex with multiple variables, alternative options, and design stages. To manage decisions that exceed cognitive capacity to consider all options, decision makers often create mental shortcuts (heuristics), and accompanied errors (biases). The potential cognitive biases when dealing with complex decisions about infrastructure are examined and an approach to reframe the decision process during infrastructure planning is explored. A more critical analysis is then provided for decision aids, like energy codes and rating metrics (e.g. LEED and Envision), which are intended to reduce complexity and improve decision making using set goals and scaled points for achieving predefined objectives in sustainability. However, unintentionally, these tools may create additional biases that limit the higher achievements in sustainability that are possible. For instance, framing a decision as a loss, rather than a gain, in value can reduce the decision makers' acceptance of risk and, in turn, influence the outcome. The Envision rating system for sustainable infrastructure is presented to measure the influence of framing effects on engineering decision environments. Envision's current framework, starts users with zero points and points are achieved when design considerations move beyond conventional construction standards. In a modified version of Envision, a higher benchmark is set. Users are endowed points and can lose points for not maintaining high consideration for sustainability. Students (n=41) and professional engineers (n=65) were randomly assigned the replica Envision software or the modified version endowing points. Participants were asked to make design considerations for a redevelopment project using Envision. The results indicate, the endowed version significantly improved students' and professional engineers' consideration for sustainability design achievement. The student participants that were endowed points (n=16) scored 63 percent of possible points compared to the standard group's (n=25) 44 percent (p=0.002). The professional engineers that were endowed points (n=32) achieved 66 percent of possible points compared to the standard group's (n=33) 51 percent (p=0.002). Both students and professional engineers that were endowed points acted loss averse trying to maintain the initial points in sustainability given. These findings suggest engineers' process design decisions by comparing alternative options. And options framed as a loss or gain in value affects the decision outcome. This research underscores the advances possible at the intersection of behavioral science and engineering for sustainability. Slight changes in framing decision aids can lead to greater achievement in sustainability, and at a relatively low cost to implement. Future research should continue to explore how engineers make decisions and what behavioral and decision theories can merge with engineering to encourage more sustainable infrastructure outcomes.

Method: We compared the organisation and technical infrastructure supporting evidence-based medicine (EBM) with the situation in software engineering. We considered the impact that factors peculiar to software engineering (i.e. the skill factor and the lifecycle factor) would have on our ability to practice evidence-based software engineering (EBSE). Results: EBSE promises a number of benefits by encouraging integration of research results with a view to supporting the needs of many different stakeholder groups. However, we do not currently have the infrastructure needed for widespread adoption of EBSE. The skill factor means software engineering experiments are vulnerable to subject and experimenter bias. The lifecycle factor means it is difficult to determine how technologies will behave once deployed. Conclusions: Software engineering would benefit from adopting what it can of the evidence approach provided that it deals with the specific problems that arise from the nature of software engineering.},

The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).},

	abstract = {Purpose – The paper aims to present a conceptual framework that helps in incorporating sustainability into 
software projects, highlights the importance of project sustainability and provides an extensive review of 
recent relevant contributions across various fields. 
Design/methodology/approach – The authors carried out a systematic bibliographic search on relevant 
published materials to analyse links between the two disciplines (sustainability and software projects). 
Furthermore, content analysis was applied to the final selected publications to identify and classify relevant 
triple bottom line (TBL) aspects to develop the framework. 
Findings – The inclusion of TBL-related aspects is the most efficient and effective method used to incorporate 
sustainability into projects. Most of the relevant contributions in the software literature have focussed on either 
project product or project process or on one or two dimensions of sustainability rather than the three 
dimensions of the TBL theory. This study contributes by proposing a conceptual framework that encompasses 
TBL-related aspects for incorporating sustainability into processes and products of software projects. 
Research limitations/implications – Validating the proposed framework empirically could be an 
interesting research issue. In addition, future works may focus on different types of industries, such as 
information systems, telecommunications and service sectors, which have seldom been studied in the literature. 
Practical implications – Software companies – or other relevant organisations – may use the proposed 
framework as a measurement tool to evaluate the environmental and social impacts of their current products 
and project management practices. Consequently, these organisations may pay more attention to incorporating 
sustainability into their project management practices. 
Originality/value – The proposed framework may contribute towards a more sustainable orientation by 
providing a unique combination of TBL-related aspects that gives academics and practitioners a better 
understanding of how software projects can be managed sustainably.

Lacking the ability to identify or quantify these facto rs, software practitioners will not learn from the failures caused by them. Although, social factors give rise to high failure rates in software development projects they tend to be ignored. Business continues as usual. The inability for software engineers to attain a holistic and inclusive approach will leave the social dimension out and undermine the realization of a fully sustainable software development process. This paper builds on the master’s thesis with the same title completed in December 2019 at Stockholm University. The thesis demonstrates how research literature on software development processes addresses (or not) the social dimension of sustainability from a holistic point of vi ew. The results indicate that the practice of dealing holistically with complexity including the social dimension is still underdeveloped. Further research is suggested regarding the development of adequate supporting tools, social skills, and managerial attitudes and behaviors.},

	abstract = {Decision support tools (DSTs) are increasingly being used to assist with asset acquisition and management decisions. Whether these tools are “fit for purpose” will have both economic and non-economic implications. Despite this, the on-going governance of DST performance receives only limited attention within both the academic and industry literature. This work addresses that research gap. Within this paper a conceptual process for managing the operational performance of decision support tools is presented. The novelty of the approach is that it aligns with the ISO 5500x:2014 Asset Management Standard, therefore introducing consistency in the governance of DSTs with physical engineered assets. A case study of the UK’s National Grid Electricity Transmission (NGET) is used to inform the approach design. The evaluation demonstrates it to be both logical and useable within the context of NGET and they have expressed an intention to implement the approach within their business. A key finding of the research was that DSTs transcend functions and organisations. This is significant and can lead to a situation whereby performance and criticality are interpreted and measured differently. The introduction of a common approach for managing DST performance works towards improving consistency and creating a shared understanding.},

	abstract = {While general purpose scientific software has enjoyed great success in industry and academia, domain specific scientific software has not yet become well-established in many disciplines where it has potential. Based on a survey of the literature as well as the authors’ experiences contributing to Econ-ARK, a structural modeling toolkit for Economics, we argue that this is due to the well-documented skills gap that prevents researchers, publishers, and professors from making the most of the opportunities afforded by scientific software. When researchers professionalize their code, it enables more cumulative progress in research and facilitates technology transfer. When publishers release interactive computational artifacts, it enables constructionist learning of the material. When students are trained in software engineering, they can participate fully in the reproduction of their scientific field. This is especially the case for fields where scientific knowledge is represented in software code, as in the case of Economics. The skills gap will not be closed until software engineering is considered a core skill for the discipline. Software engineering should be reconceived as a research method.},

Researchers often use these studies to pilot experiments before they are carried out in industrial environments. Reports on these studies usually focus on the results obtained and issues such as their external validity. However, the effects and value of empirical studies with students may go beyond the contribution to scientific literature. For instance, the pedagogical challenges and value of these studies is hardly ever stressed. In this paper, we identify four primary actors that are involved in these empirical studies, i.e., researchers, students , instructors, and industry. We discuss the costs and benefits of empirical studies with students for these actors, which are different because of the actors' different goals, expectations, and constraints, which must be recognized to fully exploit empirical studies with students.

With the increasingly widespread use of embedded systems, however, power/energy consumption is also becoming an important issue. This is particularly true for battery-operated devices where power consumption has first class status along with performance and form factor. This paper makes the following contributions. First, we present two low-level (back-end) compiler optimizations for energy reduction. An important conclusion drawn from evaluating the impact of these optimizations is that compiling for power/energy is different from compiling for execution cycles. Second, we evaluate widely used state-of-the-art high-level compiler optimizations from a power consumption perspective. Further, we compare the relative impact of these high-level optimizations on both energy and performance metrics in order to identify any differences in optimizing for energy and performance. Finally, we cover a set of optimizations that are designed specifically for exploiting low power features supported by the hardware. In particular, we show how loop and data transformation can be used to exploit low-power mode control mechanisms available in some memory architectures.},

On top of these models, we build familiar high-level primitives such as control logic, memory allocation, and garbage collection with zero energy complexity and only constant-factor overheads in space and time complexity, enabling simple expression of energy-efficient algorithms. We analyze several classic algorithms in our models and develop low-energy variations: comparison sort, insertion sort, counting sort, breadth-first search, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, matrix all-pairs shortest paths, AVL trees, binary heaps, and dynamic arrays.

However, in many software development projects, sustainability is treated as an afterthought, as developers are driven by time-to-market pressure and are often not educated to apply sustainability-improving techniques. While software engineering research and practice has suggested a large amount of such techniques, a holistic overview is missing and the effectiveness of individual techniques is often not sufficiently validated. On this behalf we created a catalog of "software sustainability guidelines" to support project managers, software architects, and developers during system design, development, operation, and maintenance.

A research gap was identified in the literature concerning the study of the amount of energy that these systems need for their operation, and the energy efficiency that may be attained depending on their design. After the selection of five representative PHRs, a total of 20 tasks commonly done, and based on previous work, were performed with regard to two proposed scenarios, namely patient use and health personnel usage. The power consumption of the main components of a host machine was measured during the performance of the proposed duties. To that end, a hardware tool called the Energy Efficiency Tester was employed. The data collected were analyzed statistically, and significant differences were found in the respective consumption of the display (χ2 (4)=23.782, p=0.000), the processor (χ2 (4)=29.018, p=0.000) and the whole PC (χ2 (4)=28.582, p=0.000). For all of these components, NoMoreClipBoard was the personal health record that required the least energy (57.699 W for the display, 3.162 W for the processor and 181.113 W for the whole PC). A total of two strong correlations were found in the energy consumption between the hard disk and the graphics card (r=0.791, p{\textless}0.001), and the processor and the PC (r=0.950, p{\textless}0.001). Some features generated special amounts of power consumption, such as the news wall found on PatientsLikeMe, or the use of load icons that had an impact on most PC components. In addition, an in-depth analysis of the user interfaces was performed. A discussion was carried out on the design of the user interfaces, also taking into account recommendations drawn from the literature, checking for their implementation in the personal health records selected. With the aim of promoting sustainability among software developers, a best practice guideline on sustainable software design was proposed. Basic sustainability recommendations were collected for professionals to consider when developing a software system in general, and a PHR in particular.},

At the level of Engineer, a further demarcation between competence levels, often less understood by the academic community, is in the designations Chartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer. The UK-SPEC clearly sets out criteria which distinguish between the two categories. Background academic training plays an important part in the pathways leading to professional registration, and although not binding, academic qualifications that exemplify the required levels of knowledge and understanding for CEng and IEng registration are explicitly stated in the UK-SPEC. Higher level qualifications are the prime focus of HE sector engineering education providers as well as their clients, i.e. the students, in the context of a highly competitive recruitment setting. This paper recognises that a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding of core engineering principles and concepts is essential to further learning and continuity of progress. Based on this platform, gradual development of students' critical thinking and analytical ability to solve real engineering problems is the key to their future success towards innovation and progress as a practicing engineer. Thus intelligent curriculum design and imaginative delivery strategies are crucial to progressively build up confidence through core engineering subjects. The study draws attention to examples of effective use of state-of-the-art analytical software to enhance student learning experience and thereby develop valuable subject specific skills, and the use of project studies to develop a multitude of problem solving and transferable skills.},

For this reason, energy savings turn to be critical in green software systems. In this paper the relationship between the usability evaluations of the GUIs and the power consumption measurements of the main components of a PC were analysed. A set of 5 web-based personal health records (PHRs) were selected as a case study. The usability assessment was performed by an expert, employing the 14 principles of design by Alan Dix as heuristics. They were scored on a Likert scale after performing a collection of common tasks in the PHRs. At the same time, an equipment to measure the energy consumption of hard disk drive, graphics card, processor, monitor and power supply was used. Spearman’s index was studied for the correlations between the usability assessments and the power consumption measurements. As a results, some weak relationships were found. A total of 5 usability heuristics were observed to may influence energy consumption when they were considered in the implementation of the PHRs. These heuristics were the following ones: consistency, task migratability, observability, recoverability and responsiveness. Based on the results, the usability principles of design cannot always be related to lower energy consumption. Future research should focus on the tradeoffs between usability and power consumption of client applications when they are used in a computer.},

Software artifacts are created, changed, reused, and change relationships in the development and maintenance processes of a software product. The complexity and variety of software artifact relationships require adequate means of description and management. They may be a software artifacts ecosystem. In the article, for the first time, a concept of a software artifact ecosystem is proposed. The concept describes a generic model of the software artifacts ecosystem, which is the Cornerstone ecosystem type and consists of three actors — the platform, the software, and the artifact. Based on the generic model, the SD model of the software artifacts ecosystem is described. The roles of actors in the ecosystem are indicated, the relationships between actors are described. The developer's activities will be more efficient, the software is understandable, and the development and maintenance is cheaper when the styles (standards) are used. As case study, based on the generic model of the software artifacts ecosystem, a declarative model of the programming style ecosystem has been developed. Three-level model of programming style artifact is proposed. The tools and processes for creating and using a programming style artifact are developed and described.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {[Context and Motivation] In the last years, software engineering researchers have contributed to defining the notion of sustainability-aware software as a quality requirement. [Question/problem] The field is, however, still missing instruments supporting the design and assessment of software sustainability. [Objective] This research aims at providing a validated Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) through a long-term empirical study in close-collaboration with the software industry. [Methodology] By using the partici-patory technical action-research method, we validate the sustainability-quality model, one of the instruments of the SAF framework, by means of investigating its applicability in an industrial software project and detecting potential improvements. [Results] Our results confirm the effective applicability of our model as most of its quality attributes (QAs) have been either addressed in the software project or acknowledged as relevant. The action-research method was also very useful for enriching our model by identifying QAs missing in the model (e.g. regulation compliance, data privacy). [Contribution] The sustainability-quality model can be effectively used as an instrument for identifying sustainability-quality requirements, and creating awareness on the relevance of the multidimensional sustainability nature of certain quality attributes.},

We utilized a systematic approach for constructing the classification of context information and provided a detailed definition for each item. We collected feedback from researchers as well as practitioners. The usefulness of the checklist was perceived more positively by researchers than practitioners, though they highlighted benefits (raising awareness of the importance of context and usefulness for management). The understandability was perceived positively by both practitioners and researchers. The checklist may serve as a “meta-model”, forming the basis for specific adaptations for different research areas, and as input for researchers deciding which context information to extract in systematic reviews. The checklist may also help researchers in reporting context in research papers.},

	abstract = {How does increasing digitalization affect the environment? A number of studies predict that digital-ization will ultimately reduce environmental degradation but seem to overestimate the emission-reducing effects of digitalization through increases in resource efficiency, while underestimating substantial rebound effects and negative environmental impact of the construction and maintenance of complex digital infrastructures. Additionally, the environmental benefits of decreasing consumption of one-time usage goods may be outweighed by the environmental costs of the production of ICTs and the increasing use of digital technologies. This paper analyzes the relationship between degrees of countries' level of digitalization and environmental indicators by use of a panel data set of 37 economies. It is the first paper to differentiate between emissions associated with a country's production and those connected to a country's consumption, accounting for emissions related to exports and imports. The level of digitalization in production is approximated by companies' investments in digital technologies. The chosen indicator to measure consumers' proclivity to digital technologies is online shopping behaviour. We address the problem of changes in unobserved heterogeneity by using the recently developed Group Fixed Effects estimator. Results indicate that the beneficial environmental effects of digitalization on reducing climate gas emissions slightly outweigh the undesired environmental effects, both in production and consumption. Ultimately, we find that increases in digitalization have a net positive effect on the natural environment.},

	abstract = {The need for acknowledging and managing sustainability as an essential quality of software systems has been steadily increasing over the past few years, in part as a reaction to the implications of “software eating the world”. Especially the widespread adoption of the Everything as a Service (*aaS) model of delivering software and (virtualized) hardware through cloud computing has put two sustainability dimensions upfront and center. On the one hand, services must be sustainable on a technical level by ensuring continuity of operations for both providers and consumers despite, or even better, while taking into account their evolution. On the other hand, the prosuming of services must also be financially sustainable for the involved stakeholders. In this work, we discuss the need for a software architecting approach that encompasses in a holistic manner the other two dimensions of software sustainability as well, namely the social and environmental aspects of services. We highlight relevant works and identify key challenges still to be addressed in the context of software systems operating across different models for cloud delivery and deployment. We then present our vision for an architecting framework that allows system stakeholders to work in tandem towards improving a set of sustainability indicators specifically tailored for the *aaS model.},

In contrast to the current paper-based approach for knowledge documentation, we present a statement-based approach, where each statement is linked to arguments and data of its evidence as well as to related statements. We argue that in this way, knowledge will be easier to retrieve, compare, and evaluate in contrast to current paper-based knowledge engineering in scientific search engines and digital libraries. Therefore, we present as a first step a novel multi-dimensional classification for statements in software engineering research. Statements are classified according to their research object, their kind (e.g., relevance), and their underlying evidence. This classification is validated and extended with a first systematic literature review. Additionally, we provide an example for illustration purpose.

Small scale practices challenging 'business as usual' aren't part of public discourse because they are small scale, less visible, often hard to access, easily appropriated by and seemingly unable to compete with the powerful lobby of large corporations. With Big Tech having an increasingly negative impact on the environment, and simultaneously shaping the discourse on how to best tackle the climate crisis, it is important to give voice and visibility to these alternatives. There is a rich diversity of practices and views on how network infrastructures' impact could be lowered. This study aims to make them visible through a mapping of the different terms currently in circulation used by communities of practice, with the aim of teasing out the diverse thinking informing the infrastructures that are developed, maintained and repaired. The mapping will be based on a review of relevant literature and the results from a survey conducted on Mastodon, an open source decentralized social network with a user base that includes many developers and activists working on sustainability and social justice in relation to computing.

Studies so far have presented successful results and methods to address the energy consumption of the software, indicating that different stakeholders striving for green software have different information needs with respect to their goals. However, currently there is no uniform manner to communicate measurements to the different stakeholders such that key findings are clearly identifiable and easy to understand, which is likely to hamper green software practices. In this paper we propose a metric that expresses a score for the resource utilization, such as power consumption, of a software product. The metric is designed to be a single score and is flexible to encompass those aspects that a stakeholder considers relevant in the context of software energy consumption. The metric was applied on two applications and allowed for objective comparison of application configurations and versions. Also the behavior of these applications across different hardware configurations could be analyzed. In addition to the metric we investigate means to visualize measurements which enhances communication and helped with highlighting the key findings.},

This is the case for Green ICT maturity models, whose aim is typically to either provide insight on the important aspects an organisation or a researcher should take into account when trying to improve the social or environmental impact of ICT, or to assist in the auditing of such aspects. In fact, when we were commissioned a comprehensive ICT-sustainability auditing for Utrecht University, we not only faced the need of selecting a Green ICT maturity model, but also to ensure that it covered as many organisational aspects as possible, extending the model if needed. This paper reports on the comparison we carried out of several Green ICT maturity models, how we extended our preferred model with needed constructs, and how we applied the resulting model during the ICT-sustainability auditing.},

Implementing sustainability initiatives has become a priority for the social and environmental awareness of organizations that want to stay ahead of the curve. One of the business areas that has, more than others, proven to be a vital asset and a potential ally of the environment, is the area of Information Technology (IT). Through this area, Green IT practices advocate sustainability in and by IT. However, organizations have a significant handicap in this regard, due to the lack of specific Green IT standards and frameworks that help them carry out this type of sustainability practices. Objective: We have developed the “Governance and Management Framework for Green IT” (GMGIT), which establishes the necessary characteristics to implement Green IT in organizations, from the point of view of the governance and management of this area. After developing and validating a first version of this framework, we have performed a set of improvements, obtaining the GMGIT 2.0, which we want to validate. Method: We have conducted a series of empirical validations at international level based on case studies, whose characteristics and results are presented in this study. Results: The results of this multi-case study show an example of the current situation of organizations in Green IT, as well as the resolution of problems encountered during the validations conducted with the GMGIT 1.0. Conclusion: The findings obtained demonstrate the usefulness, applicability, and validity of the framework when implementing, auditing, and improving Green IT in organizations in a systematic and progressive manner.},

	abstract = {Sustainability in the software and Information Technology (IT) industry has previously been discussed by practitioners mostly with a focus on maintainability and extensibility. In turn, the ecological and environmental dimensions of sustainability have been neglected. Previous research has shown that there are obstacles in the industry in terms of knowledge, experience, and support. Lack of knowledge stems from a lack of tools to detect and determine factors that affect environmental sustainability in software development, such as energy consumption. Furthermore, examining employees’ motivations, attitudes, and discretionary behaviours is important to understand how implementation can be enabled and sustained. The purpose of this study is to find practices and tools for achieving environmental sustainability in software development as well as understanding what factors are hindering software engineers from adopting sustainable practices and tools that already exist. A qualitative single case study was conducted with semi-structured interviews as the primary method for data collection. The interviews were performed with individuals with various roles within software engineering as well as their managers. The findings show that the focus on environmental sustainability in software development is insufficient as for now. Practices, such as, reduction of CPU cycles and inactivating idle programs are suggested as environmentally friendly. Additionally, the findings display hinders in areas such as responsibility, requirements, and knowledge. Organizations and their stakeholders have to prioritize and work against these hindrances in order to succeed with environmental efforts.},

	abstract = {With the growing energy demand connected to the use of data and more specifically digital services, there is action required to make the software engineering industry sustainable both now and in the future. There are different aspects to consider when talking about sustainable software. Both the aspect of developing sustainable software as well as how much you as an end-user use the software and thus how much energy you use. The goal of this thesis is to find out how it is possible, through software, to affect end-users to become more aware of the impact they have on the environment while making use of different software and at the same time make sure that future software is sustainable. The method used to reach the goal of the thesis was an exploratory case study. This consisted of a literature study to create a basis for the survey in the study. Following, based on the survey results interviews were held to deepen and broaden the knowledge gained through the survey. Finally, a checklist with suggestions on how to impact the users of software was put together based on the three previous steps. This checklist was further validated with help from a focus group. The literature review resulted in an understanding of the field and previous re- search conducted. Following, the survey resulted in an understanding of the charac- teristics of the end-users of digital services and software. Moving on, the interviews resulted in a deeper knowledge and understanding of what the best ways to impact the end-users to act more sustainable would be. Finally, the general outcome and contribution of the study was a checklist consisting of suggestions on how to make end-users awareness of software’s environmental impact increase as well as what to consider and what not to do in this regard. It can be concluded that there is a need to raise awareness with end-users of software for them to act more sustainable. Further, it can be concluded that there should be information provided to increase this awareness and that this, in turn, should be based on the end-user’s individual motivators. Overall, it can be concluded that the most important aspect is to through the provided checklist try and make the end-users aware that no matter what software they use, it has an impact on the environment},

	abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) is a key area to address sustainability concerns in system development. Approaches have been proposed to elicit sustainability requirements from interested stakeholders before system design. However, existing strategies lack the proper high-level view to deal with the societal and long-term impacts of the transformation entailed by the introduction of a new technological solution. This paper proposes to go beyond the concept of system requirements and stakeholders' goals, and raise the degree of abstraction by focusing on the notions of drivers, barriers and impacts that a system can have on the environment in which it is deployed. Furthermore, we suggest to narrow the perspective to a single domain, as the effect of a technology is context-dependent. To put this vision into practice, we interview 30 cross-disciplinary experts in the representative domain of rural areas, and we analyse the transcripts to identify common themes. As a result, we provide drivers, barriers and positive or negative impacts associated to the introduction of novel technical solutions in rural areas. This RE-relevant information could hardly be identified if interested stakeholders were interviewed before the development of a single specific system. This paper contributes to the literature with a fresh perspective on sustainability requirements, and with a domain-specific framework grounded on experts' opinions. The conceptual framework resulting from our analysis can be used as a reference baseline for requirements elicitation endeavours in rural areas that need to account for sustainability concerns.},

Therefore, energy efficiency of software products has become a popular agenda for both industry and academia in recent years. Designing such software is now a core initiative of software development companies aiming toward social responsibility. Meanwhile, however, developing environmentally sustainable software products is a challenge in that performance, functionality and energy consumption can reflect conflicting goals. In this paper, our objective is to analyze the effects of different features on energy consumption of the IBM DB2, a commonly used database product. The empirical work focuses on three features. We executed a workload in preconfigured software with some features enabled or disabled and with different numbers of users. To compare the different scenarios, three sets of green metrics were utilized. The metric set identified various parts of the software system where energy is consumed. Our findings may suggest that the conflicts among software system performance, functionality, and energy consumption can be mitigated by choosing a combination of features that interact in a way that improves energy efficiency.},

	title = {Undecided? {A} board game about intertemporal choices in software projects},
	abstract = {Software projects teem with choices that have a temporal component-i.e. they involve uncertain future outcomes that are spread in time. In the field of Judgment and Decision Making, such decisions are called "Intertemporal Choice" situations. The board game "Undecided?" simulates a software project through a series of intertemporal choices made by a team decision. It is designed to be educational and fun, but its aim is to provide a platform for cognitive and social studies of decision making in software projects. This paper describes the game and outlines possible research designs. 1. Overview Software projects teem with choices that have a temporal component-i.e. they involve uncertain future outcomes that are spread in time. In the field of Judgment and Decision Making, which draws on psychology, behavioural economics, neuroscience and other fields, such decisions are called "Intertemporal Choice" situations. In software projects, such choices surface in many areas including technical debt management, iteration planning, personnel development, requirements prioritization, test automation, refactoring, code documentation, and many other issues (Becker et al., 2018, 2017). The temporal distance at which various outcomes occur in such situations has a marked effect on how they are perceived, considered, evaluated, judged, and selected. But even within Judgment and Decision Making, there is no one robust theory about how exactly people really make up their mind in these situations-neither on the individual nor on the group level. We have performed initial behavioral studies to establish the relevance of intertemporal choice in technical debt decisions (Becker et al., 2019; Fagerholm et al., 2019), but these studies have not yet examined just how professionals make their judgment. The board game "Undecided?" simulates a software project through a series of choices made by a team decision. In each round, the team makes a choice on a next "move" by selecting from a number of cards at their disposal. Each move has uncertain effects in four dimensions (internal quality, external quality, process, and team), some of which are spread in time. At periodic intervals, the team is faced with challenges-meeting thresholds for each dimension; handling unforeseen events; justifying their choices. The game is designed to be fun and educational-we anticipate it being played as part of a moderated workshop and used for a debriefing discussion. But it is also designed to be a platform we can use to study how teams consider the temporal aspects of their choices. The game materials will be made available at cost to anyone interested. An app for hybrid and online play is in development. In this contribution, we present the game design and outline possible research designs. At PPIG, we organized a gameplay and discussion mini-workshop on multiple boards. Gameplay takes about 60-90 minutes. We then debriefed with the participants; provided a bit more context on the intertemporal nature of decisions and our initial ideas for study designs; and finally, discussed possible applications, extensions, educational applications, and study designs. Below, we introduce key concepts of intertemporal choice, describe the game design, and outline possible research designs for studies using the game to examine how people make intertemporal choices. 2. Intertemporal choices in programming, software engineering, and systems design "Intertemporal choice" (Loewenstein et al., 2003) is the technical term psychology and adjacent disciplines-behavioural economics, neuropsychology, neuroeconomics (Loewenstein et al., 2008) and other disciplines studying Judgment and Decision Making (The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of judgment and decision making, 2015)-give to decisions between uncertain outcomes that are distributed across time. The choices may or may not be explicitly listed and distinguished; and their probability may be clear or less clear.

	abstract = {1. In the middle of the 20th century, we saw our planet from space for the first time. Historians may eventually find that this vision had a greater impact on thought than did the Copernican revolution of the 16th century, which upset the human self-image by revealing that the Earth is not the centre of the universe. From space, we see a small and fragile ball dominated not by human activity and edifice but by a pattern of clouds, oceans, greenery, and soils. Humanity's inability to fit its activities into that pattern is changing planetary systems, fundamentally. Many such changes are accompanied by life-threatening hazards. This new reality, from which there is no escape, must be recognized - and managed. 2. Fortunately, this new reality coincides with more positive developments new to this century. We can move information and goods faster around the globe than ever before; we can produce more food and more goods with less investment of resources; our technology and science gives us at least, the potential to look deeper into and better understand natural systems. From space, we can see and study the Earth as an organism whose health depends on the health of al its parts. We have the power to reconcile human affairs with natural laws and to thrive in the process. In this our cultural and spiritual heritages can reinforce our economic interests and survival imperatives. 3. This Commission believes that people can build a future that is more prosperous, more just, and more secure. Our report, Our Common Future, is not a prediction of ever increasing environmental decay, poverty, and hardship in an ever more polluted world among ever decreasing resources. We see instead the possibility for a new era of economic growth, one that must be based on policies that sustain and expand the environmental resource base. And we believe such growth to be absolutely essential to relieve the great poverty that is deepening in much of the developing world. 4. But the Commission's hope for the future is conditional on decisive political action now to begin managing environmental resources to ensure both sustainable human progress and human survival. We are not forecasting a future; we are serving a notice - an urgent notice based on the latest and best scientific evidence - that the time has come to take the decisions needed to secure the resources to sustain this and coming generations. We do not offer a detailed blueprint for action, but instead a pathway by which the peoples of the world may enlarge their spheres of cooperation},

	abstract = {Grounded Theory (GT), a sociological research method designed to study social phenomena, is increasingly being applied to investigate human-centric and social aspects of software engineering. Despite its strong potential, GT remains a largely misunderstood, misused, and poorly presented and evaluated method in software engineering. Inevitably, software engineering researchers attempt to adapt traditional GT to suit their unique socio-technical contexts but without philosophical rationales or methodological justification. At the heart of these challenges lies the misalignment of GT's traditional social sciences approach to studying what is an inherently and inextricably socio-technical discipline and the absence of clear methodological guidelines to bridge the gap. Motivated by the needs of the software engineering research community and an acknowledgement of the misalignment of the traditional GT methods to studying an increasingly socio-technical world, this paper outlines the Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) method, a variant of the traditional GT methods. With its unique socio-technical lens, STGT presents philosophical and methodological guidance for studying socio-technical phenomena and theory development in software engineering and related disciplines.},

Sustainable development implies a resource management that at the same time guarantees the satisfaction of the present and future generations, usually defined in a holistic way that involves social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Software sustainability is software endurance that leads software development to accomplish results effectively for a long period.

	title = {A {Sustainability} {Catalogue} for {Software} {Modelling}},
	abstract = {Sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the needs of our future generations. It covers five different dimensions: environmental, economic, social, technical, and individual. Such dimensions are also of interest for software. For example, memory and power efficiency have an impact on the environmental dimension, the reduction of costs in software development and evolution relates to the economic dimension, the use of software for general improvement of people’s lives affects the social dimension, the software’s ability to cooperate with other systems impacts the technical dimension, and the improvement of well-being of individuals relates to the individual dimension. These various dimensions and their properties impact on each other and on the base requirements of a system. Therefore, well-informed design decisions require improved support to reason on such intra- and inter-relationships and impacts, early in development. The objective of this dissertation is to propose a catalog of sustainability requirements for later reuse during the software development process. The envisioned solution involves using requirement engineering activities to address sustainability in the early stages of the software development. The first step towards a solution was to perform a (agile) systematic mapping study in order to gain a complete and profound knowledge about the existing sustainability and requirement engineering techniques. This study was the base of our work. Our final artifact is a sustainability catalogue. This catalogue addresses four out of the five dimensions of sustainability, as well as their qualities and relationships. We did not treat the individual dimension, for sake of simplicity and time constraints, although we consider that some of its properties are included in the social dimension. The catalogue was developed using the iStar framework, and it was implemented in the piStar Tool. Such catalogue offers a generic approach that can be instantiated for particular application domains, and for any combination of dimensions. Hence, this work will contribute to the field of sustainable software development.},

	abstract = {Energy efficiency metrics are important tools for data center operators to optimize their facilities and thereby decreasing operational expenses while strengthen competitiveness. However, commonly used metrics like Power Usage Effectiveness do not consider productivity or suitable proxy indicators, thus lacking the ability for correctly comparing energy efficiency between data centers. Also, other known metrics which consider productivity, do this in a subjective way, i.e. results are only comparable for the same definitions. In order to address these shortcomings we proposed the Load Dependent Energy Efficiency (LDEE) metric, which uses a combination of utilization, performance, and power models to provide detailed efficiency data. By using load dependent models the concrete workloads are abstracted realizing comparability. Furthermore, models are trained with public information such as hardware specifications and benchmark results to avoid disruption of operation and thereby increasing applicability. This paper focuses on the utilization and performance models of LDEE.},

However, they also consume an immense amount of components. At the end-of-service-life, this piles up to a rising e-waste issue. On top of that comes the cause of all these issues: the growing amount of data that leads to more computation need. This paper applies the knowledge of the circular economy on selected issues of data centers and evaluates the implications on five dimensions of sustainability. For improving sustainability, methods of the circular economy emerge as a perfect fit for the data center. Circular methods impact mainly the economic, environmental and technical dimensions. With those methods, the raw material consumption can be lowered significantly. A general reduction of resource demand can be achieved by cutting computation need. In addition, this paper noticed that data centers can affect also the human and social dimensions and therefore are able to let humans thrive and increase the cultural residency if the data center industry were to work actively in this direction.},

	abstract = {The two big fields of sustainability and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) are Green IT (how can we make ICT itself more sustainable) and Green by IT (how can we encourage sustainability by ICT). Taking a deeper look, software links these two areas: Regarding Green IT, there are a lot of solutions to build and use hardware in a more energy efficient way. But the debate how energy-intensive software might be is just beginning. In contrast, Green by IT is often software-based, e.g. by tools that help to optimize logistics and automate processes to save energy. But until now there are no considerations about the energy saving potential of software itself. Therefore, it is useful to take a closer look at what green software and green software engineering are. In our paper, we will describe a reference model for green and sustainable software, as well as its engineering and also give some definitions. Though, we will just give a short introduction of the model itself and, to distinguish our work from our previous research, zoom in on the sub model “Sustainability Criteria for Software Products”. Additionally, we describe a model to measure the energy efficiency of software and give an example of measuring results in our contribution. The next step is to clearly differentiate from other measurement models to position our approach within other efforts of software’s energy consumption.},

We followed a multiple case study research method with the main objective ofinvestigating the applicability of the sustainability model in different contexts. We aim also to enrich our model, by means of identifying missing quality attributes or new contributions to the sustainability dimensions. We selected two software projects as cases of our study, where each one was independently conducted in specific situations. Results. The results of the study show that the relevant quality requirements identified in both projects (cases) are covered by most of the QAs related to the social (82\%) and technical (83\%) dimensions. Moreover, some QAs that were not addressed in the corresponding projects, their relevance like context completeness, and flexibility were acknowledged. These results suggest that the software sustainability model could support the identification of relevant QAs. The case study also contributed to identify QAs that had not been considered in the economic, technical and social dimensions of the sustainability-quality model.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a framework for software sustainability profiling. The goal of the framework is to analyse sustainability requirements for long-living software systems, fo-cusing on usability and readability of the sustainability profiles. To achieve this goal, we apply a quantitate approach such as fuzzy rating scale-based questionnaires to rank the sustainability requirements, and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to analyse the results of questionnaires and to provide a basis for system profiling. The core profiling elements provided by our framework are (1) a sustainability five-star rating, (2) visualisation of the five sustainability dimensions as a pentagon graph detailing combination for individual, social, technical, economic and environmental dimensions, and (3) a bar graph of overall sustainability level for each requirement. To ensure sustainability, the proposed profiling framework covers the five dimensions of sustainability to quantify the sustainability of any software system not only during the requirement gathering phase but also during maintenance phase of software system lifecycle.},

	abstract = {Sustainable living, ie, living within the bounds of the available environmental, social, and economic resources, is the focus of many present-day social and scientific discussions. But what does sustainability mean within the context of software engineering? In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of 8 case studies to address this question within the context of a specific software engineering approach, software product line engineering (SPLE). We identify the sustainability-related characteristics that arise in present-day studies that apply SPLE. We conclude that technical and economic sustainability are in prime focus on the present SPLE practice, with social sustainability issues, where they relate to organisations, also addressed to a good degree. On the other hand, the issues related to the personal sustainability are less prominent, and environmental considerations are nearly completely amiss. We present feature models and cross-relations that result from our analysis as a starting point for sustainability engineering through SPLE, suggesting that any new development should consider how these models would be instantiated and expanded for the intended sociotechnical system. The good representation of sustainability features in these models is also validated with 2 additional case studies.},

Research about sustainability in computer science aims to offer methods, techniques and tools to lessen the impact of new technologies on the environment, to offer a better world, a smarter life, to the next generations. Information systems must participate in the collective effort to move towards sustainable development, and software and application companies must lead a CSR strategy to achieve this aim. Moreover, beyond an individual company approach, sustainability should be seen as an integral quality of any software (as well as safety, performance or reliability). All of this seem obvious at a time when applications and programs of all kinds are ubiquitous in everyday life. Nevertheless, the challenges of sustainable development have still not been considered in certain key sectors such as the development of information technology. A lot of ecolabels exist for a lot of different products, although not for software sustainability.

	abstract = {Sustainability is a concept for which exist many definitions, but most of them are either vague or too limited; no consensus has been achieved. One pragmatic solution is to provide an implicit definition by setting up a standard with criteria that have to be fulfilled, e.g., by a company in order to reach their self-set sustainability goals. The problem is that even with a defined goal or strategy for sustainability, practitioners lack of reference frameworks to align to and from there to derive concrete objectives and activities. Consequently, it is hard to implement such goals or strategies through the use of IT. This paper presents the application of the IMAGINE approach [5], for analyzing and assessing sustainability, on a system supported by IT and software systems. The approach was implemented and its applicability assessed in an industrial case study in a Master student's research project. The approach provides project managers, business analysts, and requirements engineers with the capability to devise a specific strategy for particular contexts and sustainability goals.},

Consequently, software products, especially socio-technical systems, have more or less obvious impacts on almost all areas of our society. For this purpose, a group of scientists worldwide has developed the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF) which examines the impacts on five interrelated dimensions: social, individual, environmental, economic, and technical. According to this framework, we should design software to maintain or improve the Sustainability Impacts. Designing for sustainability is a major challenge that can profoundly change the field of activity - particular for Software Engineers. Objectives: The aim of the thesis work is to analyze the current role of Software Engineers and relate it to Sustainability Impacts of Software Products in order to contribute to this paradigm shift. This should provide a basis for follow-up works. The question in which direction exactly the Software Engineer should develop and how exactly this path can be followed is still owed by the scientific community. Perhaps universities will have to adapt the curriculum in the training of Software Engineers, politics could possibly initiate support programs in the field of sustainability for software companies, or maybe software sustainability certifications could emerge. In any case, Software Engineers must adapt to the times and acquire the necessary knowledge, the skills and the competencies. Results: The results of the dissertation are a better understanding of the needed paradigm shift of Software Engineers and complement the SusAF that to better support sustainability design. The extended SusAF is intended for both training and corporate use.},

A system like this develops new characteristics, potentials, and risks, much like a multicellular organism, displays different properties than the unicellular organisms that it is made of. This phenomenon is called Emergence as it describes the emerging behaviour and features of a system due to the interaction of underlying components. Emerging behaviour and other systemic properties are rarely considered in software systems during the development process. In a world of increasing complexity, this poses a great risk and has already led to significant issues in the past. We are missing clear guidelines and considerations for the development stage of software in complex systems, but also for previous stages such as requirements engineering and following stages such as testing and maintenance. Developing these criteria for a new programming paradigm requires us to understand the underlying complexity phenomena, as well as the systemic behaviour of complex software systems. The aim of this work is to research what we can learn from biology and other disciplines, and how their concepts can be operationalised for the software development process. Interview rounds with an interdisciplinary expert panel shall guide the compilation of a new paradigm (or at least its criteria), which will be evaluated by the following content analysis and a second interview round.},

Specifically, their work answered four research questions relating to software defects and programming languages. With data and code provided by the authors, the present article first attempts to conduct an experimental repetition of the original study. The repetition is only partially successful, due to missing code and issues with the classification of languages. The second part of this work focuses on their main claim, the association between bugs and languages, and performs a complete, independent reanalysis of the data and of the statistical modeling steps undertaken by Ray et al. in 2014. This reanalysis uncovers a number of serious flaws that reduce the number of languages with an association with defects down from 11 to only 4. Moreover, the practical effect size is exceedingly small. These results thus undermine the conclusions of the original study. Correcting the record is important, as many subsequent works have cited the 2014 article and have asserted, without evidence, a causal link between the choice of programming language for a given task and the number of software defects. Causation is not supported by the data at hand; and, in our opinion, even after fixing the methodological flaws we uncovered, too many unaccounted sources of bias remain to hope for a meaningful comparison of bug rates across languages.},

However, ICT4S research can be ill positioned with regard to the complexity of transforming society in such a way that people and environmental ecologies can coexist in a sustainable system. The danger is that ICT4S becomes partitioned into a small subset of sustainability and using a limited set of the levers at our disposal. Grounded in the Mann-Bates maturity scale for sustainability this paper performs an analysis of the ICT4S conference corpus to measure how mature the research is in our field with regard to sustainability. Based on this analysis we identify areas in which the ICT4S community can begin to shift the maturity of research in order to promote sustainable futures. By applying the Transformation Mindset our article demonstrates through a series of illustrative how ICT4S can apply this mindset to shift ICT4S research towards more sustainable trajectories. This is an essential first step in taking stock, highlighting shortcomings and identifying opportunities in ICT for sustainability.},

This study aims to identify and analyse the existing scientific literature regarding software development methodologies and practices in software start-ups published between January 2006 and December 2017 using the systematic mapping study. The results identified 37 relevant primary studies out of 1982 papers. To validate the results from the mapping study, an empirical study was based on the research data collected from 14 real-life software start-ups located in Finland, Italy and Norway. The result shows that Agile and Lean start-up methodologies are the most commonly used in software start-ups due to the flexible nature and easy tailoring. A total of 144 software development work practices are extracted from the primary studies. This study contributes to the research in several ways: (i) provides state of the art regarding software development methods and practices in software start-up contexts, (ii) reports commonly used methods along with its benefits identified in primary studies and (iii) identifies opportunities for future software start-up research.},

	abstract = {The World Wide Web and its related applications place substantial performance demands on network servers. The ability to measure the effect of these demands is important for tuning and optimizing the various software components that make up a Web server. To measure these effects, it is necessary to generate realistic HTTP client requests in a test-bed environment. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art approach for benchmarking Web servers is unable to generate client request rates that exceed the capacity of the server being tested, even for short periods of time. Moreover, it fails to model important characteristics of the wide area networks on which most servers are deployed (e.g., delay and packet loss). This paper examines pitfalls that one encounters when measuring Web server capacity using a synthetic workload. We propose and evaluate a new method for Web traffic generation that can generate bursty traffic, with peak loads that exceed the capacity of the server. Our method also models the delay and loss characteristics of WANs. We use the proposed method to measure the performance of widely used Web servers. The results show that actual server performance can be significantly lower than indicated by standard benchmarks under conditions of overload and in the presence of wide area network delays and packet losses.},

A great deal of progress has been made in the development of middleware and techniques to facilitate the process of distributed systems through integrating reusable components and customizing middleware. However, most of these solutions tend to focus on the functional aspects of the components and how to adapt their behavior according to their needs. Although the non-functional properties of the services are equally important, because of the difficulties in representing and controlling them, they are usually neglected. This paper investigates the problem of distributed systems' non-functional properties and describes a framework that presents a solution to the problem. The framework is based on the idea of defining the non-functional properties of the services at the early stages of the design and incorporating such properties within the architecture to ease the process of managing the system at run time. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

This inter-changeability of bits and atoms is being called the maker movement, which started as a community-based, socially-driven bottom-up movement but is today also impacting mainstream manufacturing through increased efficiencies, distributed local production and the circular economy. The maker movement thus has significant promise for increasing social, economic, environmental and technical sustainability, but is it currently living up to this potential?

And it is for precisely this reason that so many of them are fixated on finding ways to improve the energy efficiency of their facilities and, in turn, trim their power costs.  This has seen the likes of Google, for example, push the envelope in terms of how they design and manage their facilities, with machine learning increasingly playing a role in how it manages the consumption habits of its datacentres.  The datacentre sector’s collective energy use is also regularly coming in for scrutiny from environmental lobbyists, campaign groups and regulators too. So, from a corporate responsibility perspective, power consumption is an area no operator can afford to ignore.

We conducted a qualitative explorative case study in the software-intensive systems industry. The study has shown that architects frequently reuse decisions but are confined to decisions they already know or have heard about. The results also suggest that architects reuse decisions in an ad-hoc manner. Moreover this study presents a conceptual model of decision-reuse and lists stakeholder concerns with regards to decisionreuse. The results of this study indicate that improving the documentation and discoverability of decisions holds a large potential to increase reuse of decisions and that decision documentation is not only important for system understanding or in the context of architecture reviews but also to support architects in upcoming projects},
