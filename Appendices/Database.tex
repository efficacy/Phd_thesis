\chapter{SQL Creation Script for the LOG Database}
\label{appendix:database}

The following SQL creation script is run when the LOG database is created or to clear all data and reset the system.

Note that the session table is named \verb!session2!. There was a table named \verb!session! in an earlier version of the LOG database but this did not contain enough columns so a new table was created. The old  \verb!session! table is no longer used.

\begin{verbatim}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS log;
CREATE TABLE log (
    t timestamptz,
    v double precision,
    i double precision,
    PRIMARY KEY(t)
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS session2;
CREATE TABLE session2 (
    scenario varchar(32),
    session varchar(32),
    status char,
    start timestamp with time zone,
    stop timestamp with time zone,
    base_start timestamp with time zone,
    base_stop timestamp with time zone,
    avg_baseline decimal,
    avg_active decimal,
    total_active decimal,
    extra_active decimal,
    description text,
    PRIMARY KEY(scenario,session)
);

GRANT ALL ON log TO logger;
GRANT ALL ON session2 TO logger;
\end{verbatim}
