Above all, endless thanks to my wife Margaret and my daughters Elizabeth and Katherine for putting up with this unexpectedly lengthy process and the associated plunge in family income.

Special thanks to Professor Nicholas Caldwell for his continuing support and for remaining professional while juggling the sometimes conflicting demands of being both PhD supervisor and line manager.

And finally, thanks to all my friends and colleagues who have helped out with suggestions, encouragement, comments, critiques, feedback and opportunities to discuss and publicise my work.
